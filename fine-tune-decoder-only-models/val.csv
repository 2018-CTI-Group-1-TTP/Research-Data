"Adobe patched 36 flaws, including critical vulnerabilities in Acrobat and Reader and its DNG Software Development Kit. Adobe has fixed 16 critical flaws across its Acrobat and Reader applications and its Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) Software Development Kit. If exploited, the flaws could lead to remote code execution. Overall, Adobe fixed vulnerabilities tied to 36 CVEs in its regularly-scheduled Tuesday security update. Those include 24 critical- and important-severity flaws in its Acrobat and Reader application, used for creating and managing PDF files, and 12 in its Adobe DNG Software Development Kit (SDK), which provides support for reading and writing DNG files used for digital photography. “Adobe is not aware of any exploits in the wild for any of the issues addressed in these updates,” according to Adobe’s Tuesday alert. Acrobat and Reader Twelve critical flaws were fixed in Acrobat and Reader. The majority of these, if exploited, can allow an attacker to launch arbitrary code execution attacks. The flaws include a heap-based buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2020-9612) that exists within the processing of JPEG2000 images, Dustin Childs, manager at Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, told Threatpost. “The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer,” Childs said. “An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.” Another code-execution flaw of note is a out-of-bounds write glitch (CVE-2020-9597). Childs said this specific bug exists within the parsing of .JPEG files. “Crafted data in a JPEG file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer,” he said. “An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.” Also of note is a flaw stemming from a specific JavaScript code embedded in a PDF file, which can lead to heap corruption (CVE-2020-9607) when opening a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC 2020.006.20034. “With careful memory manipulation, this can lead to arbitrary code execution,” said Cisco Talos researchers who discovered the flaw in a Tuesday analysis. “The victim would need to open the malicious file or access a malicious web page to trigger this vulnerability.” The remaining critical flaws enabling code execution include another out-of-bounds write glitch (CVE-2020-9594), buffer errors (CVE-2020-9605, CVE-2020-9604) and another use-after-free flaw (CVE-2020-9606). Adobe also addressed a critical race condition flaw (CVE-2020-9615) and security bypass flaws (CVE-2020-9614, CVE-2020-9613, CVE-2020-9596, CVE-2020-9592), which can be exploited by a bad actor to bypass security restrictions features. “These updates address multiple critical and important vulnerabilities,” according to Adobe’s alert. “Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.” A number of important-severity flaws were also patched, including a null pointer (CVE-2020-9610) and stack exhaustion (CVE-2020-9611) flaw, which can allow bad actors to launch denial-of-service attacks against the application. Out-of-bounds read flaws (CVE-2020-9609, CVE-2020-9608, CVE-2020-9603, CVE-2020-9602, CVE-2020-9601, CVE-2020-9600, CVE-2020-9599) and invalid memory access flaws (CVE-2020-9598, CVE-2020-9595, CVE-2020-9593) were also patched, which could be abused to access sensitive information. Affected are Acrobat and Reader DC Continuous versions 2020.006.20042 and earlier; Acrobat and Reader Classic 2017 versions 2017.011.30166  and earlier; and Acrobat and Reader Classic 2015 versions 2015.006.30518 and earlier. The patched versions for each affected product is below. Adobe had released a pre-notification security advisory for the Acrobat and Reader updates last week. Adobe DNG SDK Adobe also issued patches for flaws in versions 1.5 and earlier of its DNG SDK. Users are urged to update to version 1.5.1 of the SDK. This includes critical heap overflow flaws tied to four CVEs (CVE-2020-9589, CVE-2020-9590, CVE-2020-9620, CVE-2020-9621). If exploited, the flaws could enable remote code execution. Also patched were eight out-of-bounds read flaws (CVE-2020-9622, CVE-2020-9623, CVE-2020-9624, CVE-2020-9625, CVE-2020-9626, CVE-2020-9627, CVE-2020-9628, CVE-2020-9629) that could be abused for information disclosure. Mateusz Jurczyk with Google Project Zero was credited with discovering the flaws. In April, Adobe released security patches for vulnerabilities in its ColdFusion, After Effects and Digital Editions applications. If exploited, the flaws could enable attackers to view sensitive data, gain escalated privileges, and launch denial-of-service attacks. Also in April, Adobe released an out-of-band patch addressing critical flaws in Adobe Bridge, Adobe Illustrator and the Magento e-commerce platform. If exploited, the most severe vulnerabilities could enable remote code execution on affected systems.

"The first Top Twenty lists malicious programs, adware and potentially unwanted programs that were detected and neutralized when accessed for the first time, i.e. by the on-access scanner.  Traditionally, the first Top Twenty is relatively stable and December was no exception. The appearance of three newcomers in sixth, tenth and eleventh places pushed a few other programs down the rankings. The exception was Packed.Win32.Krap.ag, which first entered the rankings last month, and which rose three places this month. Krap.ag, like other representatives of the Packed family, detects a packing program used to pack malicious programs – in this case, rogue antivirus programs. The figures for this malicious program increased slightly, which suggests that cybercriminals are continuing to actively use these programs to turn a profit.GamezTar.a, which entered in sixth place, is a noteworthy December newcomer. This program is presented as being a toolbar for popular browsers which provides quick access to online games. Of course, it also displays irritating adverts. Additionally, it installs a number of applications that run independently of the toolbar and interfere in online activity, whether it’s searching or displaying content. The EULA (www.gameztar.com/terms.do) does cover all these functions, but the user’s attention is usually focused on the large flashing “click here, get free games” button rather than the almost invisible “terms of service” at the bottom of the screen. It’s highly recommended to read the EULA (if it exists) before downloading any software.Tenth place is taken by Trojan.Win32.Swizzor.c, a relative of Swizzor.b, which made an appearance in the rankings in August , and Swizzor.a, which dates back to May. The people behind this deftly obfuscated code are not resting on their laurels and regularly create new variants. The actual function of this Trojan is very simple – it downloads other malicious files from the Internet.The second Top Twenty presents data generated by the web antivirus component, and reflects the online threat landscape. This ranking includes malicious programs detected on web pages and malware downloaded to victim machines from web pages.  The second Top Twenty has changed far more than the first, with only a quarter of the programs which featured last month remaining in the rankings. One malicious program re-entered the Top Twenty; however, the rest of the table underwent significant changes.Gumblar.x remains the leader, but the sites infected with this malware are gradually being cleaned up by webmasters – the number of unique download attempts in December was around a quarter of those seen in November.Krap.ag, which also figures in the first Top Twenty, moved up 8 places in this ranking. Attempted downloads of this program were up 50% on last month. Just above Krap.ag is Krap.ai, which also detects a dedicated packing program used to pack rogue antivirus programs.GamezTar.a also makes an appearance in the second Top Twenty. This is unsurprising given the program’s connection to online games. Moreover, another modification of this malicious program – GamezTar.b – entered the rankings in sixteenth place.In fifth place is Trojan-Clicker.JS.Iframe.db, a typical iframe-downloader with simple obfuscation.Trojan.JS.Iframe.ez, Trojan.JS.Zapchast.bn, Packed.JS.Agent.bn, Trojan.JS.Agent.axe, Trojan-Downloader.JS.Shadraem.a, and Trojan-Downloader.JS.Kazmet.d are all scripts designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe and Microsoft products in order to download executable files. These programs vary in terms of sophistication and the complexity of obfuscation employed.Trojan-Downloader.JS.Twetti.a, in 17th place, is a very interesting example of cybercrime creativity. Lots of legitimate sites have been infected with this malware and it’s worth taking a closer look at how it works. Once decrypted, there is no trace of a link to the main executable file and no exploits or links to them! Analysis shows that the script uses an API (application programming interface) popular with both cybercriminals and Twitter.The Trojan works in the following way: it creates a request to the API which results in data on so-called “trends” – i.e. the topics most discussed on Twitter. The data returned is then used to create an apparently random domain name, which the cybercriminals have registered in advance having used a similar method, and a redirect to this domain is created. The main part of the malware (whether it’s a PDF exploit or an executable file) will be placed on the domain. In other words, the malicious link and the redirect are created on the fly via an intermediary, which in this case happens to be Twitter.It should be noted that both Packed.JS.Agent.bn and Trojan-Downloader.JS.Twetti.a use a specially crafted PDF file to infect users’ computers. This file is detected as Exploit.JS.Pdfka.asd and it also made it into the second Top Twenty, entering in twelfth place. We can therefore assume that at least three of December’s malicious programs were the handiwork of a single cybercriminal gang. Also a cause for concern is that fact that programs from the TDSS, Sinowal and Zbot families – some of the most dangerous threats currently in existence – were detected among the executable files downloaded to victim machines during drive-by attacks.Overall, the trends remain the same. Attacks are becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to analyze. Their aim, in the vast majority of cases, is to make money in some way. Virtual threats are no longer purely virtual; they can cause real damage, and this is why is it vital to ensure that your computer and data are protected.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1566 Phishing","<s>[INST] The first Top Twenty lists malicious programs, adware and potentially unwanted programs that were detected and neutralized when accessed for the first time, i.e. by the on-access scanner.

"Security researchers lambasted the controversial macOS Big Sur feature for exposing users’ sensitive data. Apple has removed a contentious macOS feature that allowed some Apple apps to bypass content filters, VPNs and third-party firewalls. The feature, first uncovered in November in a beta release of the macOS Big Sur feature, was called “ContentFilterExclusionList” and included a list of at least 50 Apple apps – including Maps, Music, FaceTime, the App Store and its software update service. It has been recently removed in macOS Big Sur versions 11.2, Apple experts pointed out this week. “After lots of bad press and lots of feedback/bug reports to Apple from developers such as myself, it seems wiser (more security conscious) minds at Cupertino prevailed,” said Patrick Wardle, principal security researcher with Jamf, this week. “The ContentFilterExclusionList list has been removed (in macOS 11.2 beta 2).” Click to Register – New Browser Tab Opens Researchers found these apps were excluded from being controlled by Apple’s NEFilterDataProvider feature. NEFilterDataProvider is a simple network content filter, which is used by third-party application firewalls (such as host-based macOS application firewall Little Snitch) and VPNs to filter data traffic flow on an app-by-app basis. Because these apps bypassed NEFilterDataProvider, the service could not monitor them to see how much data they were transferring or which IP addresses they were communicating with – and ultimately could not block them if something was amiss. After discovering the undocumented exclusion list back in November, security researchers criticized Apple, saying it was a liability that can be exploited by threat actors to bypass firewalls, give them access to people’s systems and expose their sensitive data. “Many (rightfully) asked, ‘What good is a firewall if it can’t block all traffic?’ I of course also wondered if malware could abuse these ‘excluded’ items to generate network traffic that could surreptitiously bypass any socket filter firewall,” said Wardle. “Unfortunately the answer was yes.” The new change means that firewalls such as LuLu – an open-source firewall that blocks outgoing unknown connections on Macs – can now comprehensively filter and block network traffic for all Apple apps, Wardle said.

"Reading Time: 2 minutes This has to be a difficult time for the IT security pros at the nation’s banks. They have been the targets of cyber attacks by the Iranians and “hactivists” intent on crippling the banking system, with reports of major denial of service attacks earlier year and the spread of banking malware. That may be the least of their troubles, though. Banks, of course, are a natural target for cyber criminals. As John Dillinger supposedly said “that’s where the money is.”   A notorious Trojan Horse virus named Zeus has been used since at least 2010 time to capture user logins to their bank accounts and fleece them. Zeus accomplishes this in one of two ways. First is the classic “man in the middle” hack. This is where a process is inserted between the browser and the web server. The user is typically redirected to a page that looks like the site they wanted to go to but is in fact operated by the criminals. They capture the users account data, but they also complete the user’s transactions so they do not immediately know they have been compromised. The other approach to steal your account information involves capturing data posted from a form. Again, they relay the data on so you don’t know they have stolen it. You’ll find out later when your bank account is drained. Zeus has been around long enough where Antivirus and firewalls should be able to detect it. Still, you should be very careful about clicking on links in emails. That’s good advice in general. Unfortunately, hackers always move on to something new. In this case, it seems to be the Carberp Trojan. It was originally designed for and used in Russian speaking countries for bank fraud. However, scripts are now available to use it in North America and US banks are now on guard. Carberp is a very sophisticated Trojan that opens a backdoor on systems to perform fraudulent banking transactions, but what makes it unique is how it is being marketed. It is not unusual for black hatters to sell their malware on the web. In 2011 the Carberp makers were offering a build kit to produce the Trojan for a fee of $10,000. However, this year they began offering an improved version and are charging as much as $40,000 per month. This is an unprecedented amount. We would hope that the high cost will limit the sales, but it is clearly a measure of how valuable the makers feel their little monster is. You should be aware that Carberp will capture the login credentials for most FTP clients, browsers and email systems. It will disable updates to the following antivirus systems: ArcaVir Avast AVG Avira BitDefender DrWeb ESET NOD32 ESET Smart Security McAfee Microsoft Security Essentials Microsoft Security Client Sophos If your antivirus system in on the above list it would be a good time to consider alternatives.

"Researchers have developed a bypass for Microsoft’s EMET exploit mitigations by targeting a design limitation of the WoW64 subsystem that provides backwards compatibility for 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems. Backwards compatibility, a necessary evil for Microsoft in its need to support so many legacy applications on Windows, may be its undoing as researchers have found a way to exploit this layer in the operating system to bypass existing mitigations against memory-based exploits. Specifically in this case, researchers at Duo Security have slid past Microsoft’s Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, or EMET, a suite of more than a dozen freely available mitigations against memory attacks that include ASLR, DEP, Export Address Table Filtering, Heapspray Allocation, and return-oriented programming mitigations. The soft spot, the researchers said, is the Windows on Windows, or WoW64, Windows subsystem that allows 32-bit software to run on 64-bit Windows machines. A sizeable sample of Duo customers shows some disturbing numbers in terms of vulnerable users. For example, 80 percent of browsers in the researchers’ sample size were 32-bit processes executing on a 64-bit host running WOW64, putting them all at risk. EMET remains a viable protection for Windows users, one that Microsoft has marketed many times as a temporary stopgap between the disclosure of a zero-day vulnerability and the availability of a patch. But in the WoW64 example, EMET can be completely bypassed. “It’s a classic, recurring problem that we see a lot in Windows where there’s a lot of legacy stuff to support, so you build a feature to facilitate that transition to run older software,” said Darren Kemp, security researcher at Duo Security. “But the side effect is that as the OSes are improving, yes you’re getting more and more security features, but they all maintain this specific compatibility layer and it’s in a path that created some interesting bypass scenarios for various security features like DEP and ASLR. We’re demonstrating that, but with an entirely different mechanism.” Duo said it reached out to Microsoft with its research and exploit, which was acknowledged. The issue, however, would likely require significant re-architecting of Windows with regard to the support of 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems, which is unlikely. “The subsystem results in some limitations, by design. And those limitations have a negative impact on security software,” Kemp said. “It’s simply a limitation of Windows. It’s not an inherent vulnerability, but it essentially makes the mitigation ineffective in essentially all cases of 32-bit software running on 64-bit version of Windows.” Kemp and his colleague and senior security researcher Mikhail Davidov modified an existing exploit for a patched Adobe Flash use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2015-0311) to get past EMET. They explain in a paper released today that 32-bit applications under WoW64 behave unlike they do in 32-bit systems; the processor’s ability to switch between execution modes at runtime opens up a number of exploit options for attackers. From the paper: “One of the most important limitations imposed by the WoW64 subsystem is that it makes it very difficult for security software to effectively hook low-level functionality from userland. Windows does not provide any ‘official’ mechanism for inserting 64-bit modules into 32-bit processes. A significant portion of the API functionality a piece of security software (i.e. EMET) would want to monitor is implemented in the 64-bit copy of ntdll.dll (process creation, module loading, etc.).” They explain that an attacker would need to transition the processor to long mode, resolve the location of 64-bit modules and functions within them and overcome the limitations of available 64-bit APIs in order to avoid the function hooks used by security software. EMET hooks into ntdll.dll, a library that provides low-level functionality that applications use. Two copies of the library exist on both sides of this process, 32-bit and 64-bit, however, they researchers explain that on the 64-bit side none of the hooks are in place. “All of those mitigations don’t exist there,” Kemp said. “We force the transition and then when everything executes, none of those hooks are present.” EMET bypasses are not new. In the last 18 months, there have been a number of high-profile exploits, most of them from the white-hat realm, that have illuminated some shortcomings in the valuable Windows security feature. Black hats too have taken an interest in EMET; the Operation Snowman APT campaign, for example, contained a module that ran a check to determine whether EMET was running on the compromised host and then made a decision as to whether to execute the remainder of the attack. “Because Microsoft is so focused on not breaking legacy technology—and from an enterprise point of view, that’s a good thing—it enabled these kinds of attacks,” Davidov said. “Even though most people are running a 64-bit version of the OS these days, you end up with a ton of 32-bit applications on the machine, which means you end up with the WoW64 subsystem on there as well, which enables EMET to be bypassed.” : Vulnerabilities","T1055 Process Injection,T1562 Impair Defenses,T1082 System Information Discovery","<s>[INST] Researchers have developed a bypass for Microsoft’s EMET exploit mitigations by targeting a design limitation of the WoW64 subsystem that provides backwards compatibility for 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems.

"In 2018, we published a report on Operation AppleJeus, one of the more notable campaigns of the threat actor Lazarus, currently one of the most active and prolific APT groups. One notable feature of this campaign was that it marked the first time Lazarus had targeted macOS targets, with the group inventing a fake company in order to deliver its manipulated application and exploit the high level of trust among potential victims.Our follow-up research revealed significant changes to the group’s attack methodology. To attack macOS victims, Lazarus has developed homemade macOS malware and added an authentication mechanism to deliver the next stage payload very carefully, as well as loading the next-stage payload without touching the disk. In addition, to attack Windows victims, the group has elaborated a multi-stage infection procedure and made significant changes to the final payload. We believe Lazarus has been more careful in its attacks since the release of Operation AppleJeus and has employed a number of methods to avoid detection.We identified several victims as part of our ongoing research, in the UK, Poland, Russia and China. Moreover, we were able to confirm that several of the victims are linked to cryptocurrency business organizations.Kaspersky continues to track the Roaming Mantis campaign. This threat actor was first reported in 2017, when it used SMS to distribute its malware to Android devices in just one country – South Korea. Since then, the scope of the group’s activities has widened considerably. Roaming Mantis now supports 27 languages, targets iOS as well as Android and includes cryptocurrency mining for PCs in its arsenal.Roaming Mantis is strongly motivated by financial gain and is continuously looking for new targets. The group has also put a lot of effort into evading tracking by researchers, including implementing obfuscation techniques and using allowlisting to avoid infecting researchers who navigate to the malicious landing page. While the group is currently applying allowlisting only to Korean pages, we think it is only a matter of time before Roaming Mantis implements this for other languages.Roaming Mantis has also added new malware families, including Fakecop and Wroba.j. The actor is still very active in using ‘SMiShing‘ for Android malware distribution. This is particularly alarming, because it means that the attackers could combine infected mobile devices into a botnet for malware delivery, SMiShing, and so on. In one of the more recent methods used by the group, a downloaded malicious APK file contains an icon that impersonates a major courier company brand: the spoofed brand icon is customized for the country it targets – for example, Sagawa Express for Japan, Yamato Transport and FedEx for Taiwan, CJ Logistics for South Korea and Econt Express for Russia.In March, we reported a targeted campaign to distribute Milum, a Trojan designed to gain remote control of devices in target organizations, some of which operate in the industrial sector. We detected the first signs of this operation, which we have dubbed WildPressure, in August 2019; and the campaign remains active.The Milum samples that we have seen so far do not share any code similarities with any known APT campaigns. All of them allow the attackers to control infected devices remotely: letting them download and execute commands, collect information from the compromised computer and send it to the C2 server and install upgrades to the malware.Attacks on industrial targets can be particularly devastating. So far, we haven’t seen evidence that the threat actor behind WildPressure is trying to do anything beyond gathering data from infected networks. However, the campaign is still in development, so we don’t yet know what other functionality might be added.To avoid becoming a victim of this and other targeted attacks, organizations should do the following.On January 10, we discovered a watering-hole attack that utilized a full remote iOS exploit chain to deploy a feature-rich implant named LightSpy. Judging by the content of the landing page, the site appears to have been designed to target users in Hong Kong.Since then, we have released two private reports on LightSpy, available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting (please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com for further information).We are temporarily calling the APT group behind this implant TwoSail Junk. Currently, we have hints from known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity. We are also working with fellow researchers to tie LightSpy to prior activity from a well-established Chinese-speaking APT group, previously reported (here and here) as Spring Dragon (aka Lotus Blossom and Billburg(Thrip)), known for its Lotus Elise and Evora backdoors.As this LightSpy activity was disclosed publicly by fellow researchers from Trend Micro, we wanted to contribute missing information to the story without duplicating content. In addition, in our quest to secure technologies for a better future, we have reported this malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies.Our report includes information about the Android implant, including its deployment, spread and support infrastructure.In December, we discovered watering-hole websites that were compromised to selectively trigger a drive-by download attack with fake Adobe Flash update warnings.This campaign, which has been active since at least May 2019, targets an Asian religious and ethnic group. The threat actor’s unsophisticated but creative toolset, which has evolved greatly and may still be in development, makes use of Sojson obfuscation, NSIS installer, Python, open-source code, GitHub distribution, Go language and Google Drive-based C2 channels.The threat actor’s operational target is unclear because we haven’t been able to observe many live operations. We have also been unable to identify any overlap with known APT groups.In February, Vitaly Kamluk, from the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky, reported on a new version of Bitscout, based on the upcoming release of Ubuntu 20.04 (scheduled for release in April 2020).Bitscout is a remote digital forensics tool that we open-sourced about two and a half years ago, when Vitaly was located in the Digital Forensics Lab at INTERPOL. Bitscout has helped us in many cyber-investigations. Based on the widely popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, it incorporates forensics and malware analysis tools created by a large number of excellent developers around the world.Here’s a summary of the approach we use in BitscoutWe have launched a project website, bitscout-forensics.info, as the go-to destination for those looking for tips and tricks on remote forensics using Bitscout.In recent years, we have shared our knowledge and experience of using YARA as a threat hunting tool, mainly through our training course, ‘Hunting APTs with YARA like a GReAT ninja’, delivered during our Security Analyst Summit. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to postpone the forthcoming SAS.Meanwhile, we have received many requests to make our YARA hands-on training available to more people. This is something we are working on and hope to be able to provide soon as an online training experience. Look out for updates on this by following us on Twitter – @craiu, @kaspersky.With so many people working from home, and spending even more time online, it is also likely the number of threats and attacks will increase. Therefore, we decided to share some of the YARA experience we have accumulated in recent years, in the hope that all of you will find it useful for keeping threats at bay.If you weren’t able to join the live presentation, on March 31, you can find the recording here.We track the activities of hundreds of APT threat actors and regularly highlight the more interesting findings here. However, if you want to know more, please reach out to us at intelreports@kaspersky.comAlthough many people consider macOS to be safe, there are cybercriminals who seek to exploit those who use this operating system. One malicious program stands out – the Shlayer Trojan. In 2019, Kaspersky macOS products blocked this Trojan on every tenth device, making this the most widespread threat to people who use macOS.Shlayer is a smart malware distribution system that spreads via a partner network, entertainment websites and even Wikipedia. This Trojan specializes in the installation of adware – programs that feed victims illicit ads, intercepting and gathering their browser queries and modifying search results to distribute even more advertising messages.Shlayer accounted for almost one-third of all attacks on macOS devices registered by Kaspersky products between January and November last year – and nearly all other top 10 macOS threats were adware programs that Shlayer installs.The infection starts with an unwitting victim downloading the malicious program. The criminals behind Shlayer set up a malware distribution system with a number of channels leading their victims to download the malware. Shlayer is offered as a way to monetize websites in a number of file partner programs, with relatively high payment for each malware installation made by users in the US, prompting over 1,000 ‘partner sites’ to distribute Shlayer. This scheme works as follows: a user looks for a TV series episode or a football match, and advertising landing pages redirect them to fake Flash Player update pages. From here, the victim downloads the malware; and for each installation, the partner who distributed links to the malware receives a pay-per-install payment.Other schemes that we saw led to a fake Adobe Flash update page that redirected victims from various large online services with multi-million audiences, including YouTube, where links to the malicious website were included in video descriptions, and Wikipedia, where such links were hidden in article references. People that clicked on these links would also be redirected to the Shlayer download landing pages. Kaspersky researchers found 700 domains containing malicious content, with links to them on a variety of legitimate websites.Almost all the websites that led to a fake Flash Player contained content in English. This corresponds to the countries where we have seen most infections – the US (31%), Germany (14%), France (10%) and the UK (10%).Although many people still use the term “virus” to mean any malicious program, it actually refers specifically to self-replicating code, i.e., malicious code that copies itself from file to file on the same computer. Viruses, which used to dominate the threat landscape, are now rare. However, there are some interesting exceptions to this trend and we came across one recently – the first real virus we’ve seen in the wild for some time.The virus, called KBOT, infects the victim’s computer via the internet, a local network, or infected external media. After the infected file is launched, the malware gains a foothold in the system, writing itself to Startup and the Task Scheduler, and then deploys web injects to try to steal the victim’s bank and personal data. KBOT can also download additional stealer modules that harvest and send to the Command-and-Control (C2) server comprehensive information about the victim, including passwords/logins, crypto-wallet data, lists of files and installed applications, and so on. The malware stores all its files and stolen data in a virtual file system, encrypted using the RC6 algorithm, making it hard to detect.Phishers are always on the lookout for hot topics that they can use to hook their victims, including sport, politics, romance, shopping, banking, natural disasters and anything else that might entice someone into clicking on a link or malicious file attachment.Recently, cybercriminals have exploited the theme of data leaks to try to defraud people. Data breaches, and the fines imposed for failing to safeguard data, are now a staple feature of the news. The scammers posed as an organization called the “Personal Data Protection Fund” and claim that the “US Trading Commission” had set up a fund to compensate people whose personal data had been exposed.However, in order to get the compensation, the victims are asked to provide a social security number. The scammers offer to sell a temporary SSN to those who don’t have one.Even if the potential victim enters a valid SSN, they are still directed to a page asking them to purchase a temporary SSN.You can read the full story here.The bigger the hook, the bigger the pool of potential victims. So it’s no surprise that cybercriminals are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. We have found malicious PDF, MP4 and DOCX files disguised as information about the coronavirus. The names of the files suggest they contain video instructions on how to protect yourself, updates on the threat and even virus detection procedures. In fact, these files are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of the computer.The cybercriminals behind the Ginp banking Trojan recently developed a new campaign related to COVID-19. After receiving a special command, the Trojan opens a web page called Coronavirus Finder. This provides a simple interface that claims to show the number of people nearby who are infected with the virus and asks you to pay a small sum to see their location.The Trojan then provides a payment form.Then … nothing else happens – apart from the criminals taking your money. Data from the Kaspersky Security Network suggests that most users who have encountered Ginp are located in Spain. However, this is a new version of Ginp that is tagged “flash-2”, while previous versions were tagged “flash-es12”. So perhaps the lack of “es” in the tag of the newer version means the cybercriminals are planning to expand their campaign beyond Spain.We have also seen a number of phishing scams where cybercriminals pose as bona fide organizations to trick people into clicking on links to fake sites where the scammers capture their personal information, or even ask them to donate money.If you’ve ever wanted to know why it’s so easy for phishers to create spoof emails, and what efforts have been made to make it harder for them, you can find a good overview of the problems and potential solutions here.Cybercriminals are also taking the opportunity to attack the information infrastructure of medical facilities, clearly hoping that the overload on IT services will provide them with an opportunity to break into hospital networks, or are attempting to extort money from clinical research companies. In an effort to ensure that IT security isn’t something that medical teams have to worry about, we’re offering medical institutions free six-month licenses for our core solutions.In February, we reported an unusual malware campaign in which cybercriminals were spreading the AZORult Trojan as a fake installer for ProtonVPN.The aim of the campaign is to steal personal information and crypto-currency from the victims.The attackers created a spoof copy a VPN service’s website, which looks like the original but has a different domain name. The criminals spread links to the domain through advertisements using different banner networks – a practice known as malvertizing. When someone visits a phishing website, they are prompted to download a free VPN installer for Windows. Once launched, this drops a copy of the AZORult botnet implant. This collects the infected device’s environment information and reports it to the server. Finally, the attackers steal crypto-currency from locally available wallets (Electrum, Bitcoin, Etherium and others), FTP logins, and passwords from FileZilla, email credentials, information from locally installed browsers (including cookies), credentials from WinSCP, Pidgin messenger and others.AZORult is one of the most commonly bought and sold stealers on Russian forums due to its wide range of capabilities. The Trojan is able to harvest a good deal of data, including browser history, login credentials, cookies, files and crypto-wallet files; and can also be used as a loader to download other malware.Distributing malware under the guise of legitimate software updates is not new. Typically, cybercriminals invite potential victims to install a new version of a browser or Adobe Flash Player. However, we recently discovered a new approach: visitors to infected sites were informed that some kind of security certificate had expired.They were offered an update that infected them with malware – specifically the Buerak downloader and Mokes backdoor.We detected the infection on variously themed websites – from a zoo to a store selling auto parts. The earliest infections that we found date back to January 16.We have seen many mobile malware apps re-invent themselves, adding new layers of functionality over time. The Faketoken Trojan offers a good example of this. Over the last six years, it has developed from an app designed to capture one-time passcodes, to a fully-fledged mobile banking Trojan, to ransomware. By 2017, Faketoken was able to mimic many different apps, including mobile banking apps, e-wallets, taxi service apps and apps used to pay fines and penalties – all in order to steal bank account data.Recently, we observed 5,000 Android smartphones infected by Faketoken sending offensive text messages. SMS capability is a standard feature of many mobile malware apps, many of which spread by sending links to their victims’ contacts; and banking Trojans typically try to make themselves the default SMS application, in order to intercept one-time passcodes. However, we had not seen one become a mass texting tool.The messages sent by Faketoken are charged to the owner of the device; and since many of the infected smartphones we saw were texting a foreign number, the cost was quite high. Before sending any messages, the Trojan checks to see if there are sufficient funds in the victim’s bank account. If there are, Faketoken tops up the mobile account sending any messages.We don’t yet know whether this is a one-off campaign or the start of a trend. To avoid becoming a victim of Faketoken, download apps only from Google Play, disable the downloading of apps from other sources, don’t follow links from messages and protect your device with a reputable mobile security product.In January, we reported that cybercriminals were using malware to boost the rating of specific apps, to increase the number of installations.The Shopper.a Trojan also displays advertising messages on infected devices, creates shortcuts to advertising sites and more.The Trojan opens Google Play (or other app store), installs several programs and writes fake user reviews about them. To prevent the victim noticing, the Trojan conceals the installation window behind an ‘invisible’ window. Shopper.a gives itself the necessary permissions using the Android AccessibilityService. This service is intended to help people with disabilities use a smartphone, but if a malicious app obtains permission to use it, the malware has almost limitless possibilities for interacting with the system interface and apps – including intercepting data displayed on the screen, clicking buttons and emulating user gestures.Shopper.a was most widespread in Russia, Brazil and India.You should be wary if an app requests access to the AccessibilityService but doesn’t need it. Even if the only danger posed by such apps comes from automatically written reviews, there is no guarantee that its creators will not change the payload later.We recently discovered a new malicious Android Trojan, dubbed Cookiethief, designed to acquire root permissions on the victim’s device and transfer cookies used by the browser and the Facebook app to the cybercriminals’ C2 server. Using the stolen cookies, the criminals can gain access to the unique session IDs that websites and online services use to identify someone, thereby allowing the criminals to assume someone’s identity and gain access to online accounts without the need for a login and password.On the C2 server, we found a page advertising services for distributing spam on social networks and messengers, which we think is the underlying motive in stealing cookies.From the C2 server addresses and encryption keys used, we were able to link Cookiethief to widespread Trojans such as Sivu, Triada, and Ztorg. Usually, such malware is either planted in the device firmware before purchase, or it gets into system folders through vulnerabilities in the operating system and then downloads various applications onto the system.We recently discovered a new sample of stalkerware – commercial software typically used by those who want to monitor a partner, colleague or others – that contains functionality beyond anything we have seen before. You can find more information on stalkerware here and here.MonitorMinor, goes beyond other stalkerware programs. Primitive stalkerware uses geo-fencing technology, enabling the operator to track the victim’s location, and in most cases intercept SMS and call data. MonitorMinor goes a few steps further: recognizing the importance of messengers as a means of data collection, this app aims to get access to data from all the popular modern communication tools.Normally, the Android sandbox prevents direct communication between apps. However, if a superuser app has been installed, which grants root access to the system, it overrides the security mechanisms of the device. The developers of MonitorMinor use this to enable full access to data on a variety of popular social media and messaging applications, including Hangouts, Instagram, Skype and Snapchat. They also use root privileges to access screen unlock patterns, enabling the stalkerware operator to unlock the device when it is nearby or when they next have physical access to the device. Kaspersky has not previously seen this feature in any other mobile threat.Even without root access, the stalkerware can operate effectively by abusing the AccessibilityService API, which is designed to make devices friendly for users with disabilities. Using this API, the stalkerware is able to intercept any events in the applications and broadcast live audio.Our telemetry indicates that the countries with the largest share of installations of MonitorMinor are India, Mexico, Germany, Saudi Arabia and the UK.We recommend the following tips to reduce the risk of falling victim to a stalker:","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] In 2018, we published a report on Operation AppleJeus, one of the more notable campaigns of the threat actor Lazarus, currently one of the most active and prolific APT groups.

Judging by the content of the landing page, the site appears to have been designed to target users in Hong Kong.Since then, we have released two private reports on LightSpy, available to customers of Kaspersky Intelligence Reporting (please contact intelreports@kaspersky.com for further information).We are temporarily calling the APT group behind this implant TwoSail Junk. Currently, we have hints from known backdoor callbacks to infrastructure about clustering this campaign with previous activity. We are also working with fellow researchers to tie LightSpy to prior activity from a well-established Chinese-speaking APT group, previously reported (here and here) as Spring Dragon (aka Lotus Blossom and Billburg(Thrip)), known for its Lotus Elise and Evora backdoors.As this LightSpy activity was disclosed publicly by fellow researchers from Trend Micro, we wanted to contribute missing information to the story without duplicating content. In addition, in our quest to secure technologies for a better future, we have reported this malware and activity to Apple and other relevant companies.Our report includes information about the Android implant, including its deployment, spread and support infrastructure.In December, we discovered watering-hole websites that were compromised to selectively trigger a drive-by download attack with fake Adobe Flash update warnings.This campaign, which has been active since at least May 2019, targets an Asian religious and ethnic group. The threat actor’s unsophisticated but creative toolset, which has evolved greatly and may still be in development, makes use of Sojson obfuscation, NSIS installer, Python, open-source code, GitHub distribution, Go language and Google Drive-based C2 channels.The threat actor’s operational target is unclear because we haven’t been able to observe many live operations. We have also been unable to identify any overlap with known APT groups.In February, Vitaly Kamluk, from the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky, reported on a new version of Bitscout, based on the upcoming release of Ubuntu 20.04 (scheduled for release in April 2020).Bitscout is a remote digital forensics tool that we open-sourced about two and a half years ago, when Vitaly was located in the Digital Forensics Lab at INTERPOL. Bitscout has helped us in many cyber-investigations. Based on the widely popular Ubuntu Linux distribution, it incorporates forensics and malware analysis tools created by a large number of excellent developers around the world.Here’s a summary of the approach we use in BitscoutWe have launched a project website, bitscout-forensics.info, as the go-to destination for those looking for tips and tricks on remote forensics using Bitscout.In recent years, we have shared our knowledge and experience of using YARA as a threat hunting tool, mainly through our training course, ‘Hunting APTs with YARA like a GReAT ninja’, delivered during our Security Analyst Summit. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to postpone the forthcoming SAS.Meanwhile, we have received many requests to make our YARA hands-on training available to more people. This is something we are working on and hope to be able to provide soon as an online training experience. Look out for updates on this by following us on Twitter – @craiu, @kaspersky.With so many people working from home, and spending even more time online, it is also likely the number of threats and attacks will increase. Therefore, we decided to share some of the YARA experience we have accumulated in recent years, in the hope that all of you will find it useful for keeping threats at bay.If you weren’t able to join the live presentation, on March 31, you can find the recording here.We track the activities of hundreds of APT threat actors and regularly highlight the more interesting findings here. However, if you want to know more, please reach out to us at intelreports@kaspersky.comAlthough many people consider macOS to be safe, there are cybercriminals who seek to exploit those who use this operating system. One malicious program stands out – the Shlayer Trojan. In 2019, Kaspersky macOS products blocked this Trojan on every tenth device, making this the most widespread threat to people who use macOS.Shlayer is a smart malware distribution system that spreads via a partner network, entertainment websites and even Wikipedia. This Trojan specializes in the installation of adware – programs that feed victims illicit ads, intercepting and gathering their browser queries and modifying search results to distribute even more advertising messages.Shlayer accounted for almost one-third of all attacks on macOS devices registered by Kaspersky products between January and November last year – and nearly all other top 10 macOS threats were adware programs that Shlayer installs.The infection starts with an unwitting victim downloading the malicious program. The criminals behind Shlayer set up a malware distribution system with a number of channels leading their victims to download the malware. Shlayer is offered as a way to monetize websites in a number of file partner programs, with relatively high payment for each malware installation made by users in the US, prompting over 1,000 ‘partner sites’ to distribute Shlayer. This scheme works as follows: a user looks for a TV series episode or a football match, and advertising landing pages redirect them to fake Flash Player update pages. From here, the victim downloads the malware; and for each installation, the partner who distributed links to the malware receives a pay-per-install payment.Other schemes that we saw led to a fake Adobe Flash update page that redirected victims from various large online services with multi-million audiences, including YouTube, where links to the malicious website were included in video descriptions, and Wikipedia, where such links were hidden in article references. People that clicked on these links would also be redirected to the Shlayer download landing pages. Kaspersky researchers found 700 domains containing malicious content, with links to them on a variety of legitimate websites.Almost all the websites that led to a fake Flash Player contained content in English. This corresponds to the countries where we have seen most infections – the US (31%), Germany (14%), France (10%) and the UK (10%).Although many people still use the term “virus” to mean any malicious program, it actually refers specifically to self-replicating code, i.e., malicious code that copies itself from file to file on the same computer. Viruses, which used to dominate the threat landscape, are now rare. However, there are some interesting exceptions to this trend and we came across one recently – the first real virus we’ve seen in the wild for some time.The virus, called KBOT, infects the victim’s computer via the internet, a local network, or infected external media. After the infected file is launched, the malware gains a foothold in the system, writing itself to Startup and the Task Scheduler, and then deploys web injects to try to steal the victim’s bank and personal data. KBOT can also download additional stealer modules that harvest and send to the Command-and-Control (C2) server comprehensive information about the victim, including passwords/logins, crypto-wallet data, lists of files and installed applications, and so on. The malware stores all its files and stolen data in a virtual file system, encrypted using the RC6 algorithm, making it hard to detect.Phishers are always on the lookout for hot topics that they can use to hook their victims, including sport, politics, romance, shopping, banking, natural disasters and anything else that might entice someone into clicking on a link or malicious file attachment.Recently, cybercriminals have exploited the theme of data leaks to try to defraud people. Data breaches, and the fines imposed for failing to safeguard data, are now a staple feature of the news. The scammers posed as an organization called the “Personal Data Protection Fund” and claim that the “US Trading Commission” had set up a fund to compensate people whose personal data had been exposed.However, in order to get the compensation, the victims are asked to provide a social security number. The scammers offer to sell a temporary SSN to those who don’t have one.Even if the potential victim enters a valid SSN, they are still directed to a page asking them to purchase a temporary SSN.You can read the full story here.The bigger the hook, the bigger the pool of potential victims. So it’s no surprise that cybercriminals are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. We have found malicious PDF, MP4 and DOCX files disguised as information about the coronavirus. The names of the files suggest they contain video instructions on how to protect yourself, updates on the threat and even virus detection procedures. In fact, these files are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of the computer.The cybercriminals behind the Ginp banking Trojan recently developed a new campaign related to COVID-19. After receiving a special command, the Trojan opens a web page called Coronavirus Finder. This provides a simple interface that claims to show the number of people nearby who are infected with the virus and asks you to pay a small sum to see their location.The Trojan then provides a payment form.Then … nothing else happens – apart from the criminals taking your money. Data from the Kaspersky Security Network suggests that most users who have encountered Ginp are located in Spain. However, this is a new version of Ginp that is tagged “flash-2”, while previous versions were tagged “flash-es12”. So perhaps the lack of “es” in the tag of the newer version means the cybercriminals are planning to expand their campaign beyond Spain.We have also seen a number of phishing scams where cybercriminals pose as bona fide organizations to trick people into clicking on links to fake sites where the scammers capture their personal information, or even ask them to donate money.If you’ve ever wanted to know why it’s so easy for phishers to create spoof emails, and what efforts have been made to make it harder for them, you can find a good overview of the problems and potential solutions here.Cybercriminals are also taking the opportunity to attack the information infrastructure of medical facilities, clearly hoping that the overload on IT services will provide them with an opportunity to break into hospital networks, or are attempting to extort money from clinical research companies. In an effort to ensure that IT security isn’t something that medical teams have to worry about, we’re offering medical institutions free six-month licenses for our core solutions.In February, we reported an unusual malware campaign in which cybercriminals were spreading the AZORult Trojan as a fake installer for ProtonVPN.The aim of the campaign is to steal personal information and crypto-currency from the victims.The attackers created a spoof copy a VPN service’s website, which looks like the original but has a different domain name. The criminals spread links to the domain through advertisements using different banner networks – a practice known as malvertizing. When someone visits a phishing website, they are prompted to download a free VPN installer for Windows. Once launched, this drops a copy of the AZORult botnet implant. This collects the infected device’s environment information and reports it to the server. Finally, the attackers steal crypto-currency from locally available wallets (Electrum, Bitcoin, Etherium and others), FTP logins, and passwords from FileZilla, email credentials, information from locally installed browsers (including cookies), credentials from WinSCP, Pidgin messenger and others.AZORult is one of the most commonly bought and sold stealers on Russian forums due to its wide range of capabilities. The Trojan is able to harvest a good deal of data, including browser history, login credentials, cookies, files and crypto-wallet files; and can also be used as a loader to download other malware.Distributing malware under the guise of legitimate software updates is not new. Typically, cybercriminals invite potential victims to install a new version of a browser or Adobe Flash Player. However, we recently discovered a new approach: visitors to infected sites were informed that some kind of security certificate had expired.They were offered an update that infected them with malware – specifically the Buerak downloader and Mokes backdoor.We detected the infection on variously themed websites – from a zoo to a store selling auto parts. The earliest infections that we found date back to January 16.We have seen many mobile malware apps re-invent themselves, adding new layers of functionality over time. The Faketoken Trojan offers a good example of this. Over the last six years, it has developed from an app designed to capture one-time passcodes, to a fully-fledged mobile banking Trojan, to ransomware. By 2017, Faketoken was able to mimic many different apps, including mobile banking apps, e-wallets, taxi service apps and apps used to pay fines and penalties – all in order to steal bank account data.Recently, we observed 5,000 Android smartphones infected by Faketoken sending offensive text messages. SMS capability is a standard feature of many mobile malware apps, many of which spread by sending links to their victims’ contacts; and banking Trojans typically try to make themselves the default SMS application, in order to intercept one-time passcodes. However, we had not seen one become a mass texting tool.The messages sent by Faketoken are charged to the owner of the device; and since many of the infected smartphones we saw were texting a foreign number, the cost was quite high. Before sending any messages, the Trojan checks to see if there are sufficient funds in the victim’s bank account. If there are, Faketoken tops up the mobile account sending any messages.We don’t yet know whether this is a one-off campaign or the start of a trend. To avoid becoming a victim of Faketoken, download apps only from Google Play, disable the downloading of apps from other sources, don’t follow links from messages and protect your device with a reputable mobile security product.In January, we reported that cybercriminals were using malware to boost the rating of specific apps, to increase the number of installations.The Shopper.a Trojan also displays advertising messages on infected devices, creates shortcuts to advertising sites and more.The Trojan opens Google Play (or other app store), installs several programs and writes fake user reviews about them. To prevent the victim noticing, the Trojan conceals the installation window behind an ‘invisible’ window. Shopper.a gives itself the necessary permissions using the Android AccessibilityService. This service is intended to help people with disabilities use a smartphone, but if a malicious app obtains permission to use it, the malware has almost limitless possibilities for interacting with the system interface and apps – including intercepting data displayed on the screen, clicking buttons and emulating user gestures.Shopper.a was most widespread in Russia, Brazil and India.You should be wary if an app requests access to the AccessibilityService but doesn’t need it. Even if the only danger posed by such apps comes from automatically written reviews, there is no guarantee that its creators will not change the payload later.We recently discovered a new malicious Android Trojan, dubbed Cookiethief, designed to acquire root permissions on the victim’s device and transfer cookies used by the browser and the Facebook app to the cybercriminals’ C2 server. Using the stolen cookies, the criminals can gain access to the unique session IDs that websites and online services use to identify someone, thereby allowing the criminals to assume someone’s identity and gain access to online accounts without the need for a login and password.On the C2 server, we found a page advertising services for distributing spam on social networks and messengers, which we think is the underlying motive in stealing cookies.From the C2 server addresses and encryption keys used, we were able to link Cookiethief to widespread Trojans such as Sivu, Triada, and Ztorg. Usually, such malware is either planted in the device firmware before purchase, or it gets into system folders through vulnerabilities in the operating system and then downloads various applications onto the system.We recently discovered a new sample of stalkerware – commercial software typically used by those who want to monitor a partner, colleague or others – that contains functionality beyond anything we have seen before. You can find more information on stalkerware here and here.MonitorMinor, goes beyond other stalkerware programs. Primitive stalkerware uses geo-fencing technology, enabling the operator to track the victim’s location, and in most cases intercept SMS and call data. MonitorMinor goes a few steps further: recognizing the importance of messengers as a means of data collection, this app aims to get access to data from all the popular modern communication tools.Normally, the Android sandbox prevents direct communication between apps. However, if a superuser app has been installed, which grants root access to the system, it overrides the security mechanisms of the device. The developers of MonitorMinor use this to enable full access to data on a variety of popular social media and messaging applications, including Hangouts, Instagram, Skype and Snapchat. They also use root privileges to access screen unlock patterns, enabling the stalkerware operator to unlock the device when it is nearby or when they next have physical access to the device. Kaspersky has not previously seen this feature in any other mobile threat.Even without root access, the stalkerware can operate effectively by abusing the AccessibilityService API, which is designed to make devices friendly for users with disabilities. Using this API, the stalkerware is able to intercept any events in the applications and broadcast live audio.Our telemetry indicates that the countries with the largest share of installations of MonitorMinor are India, Mexico, Germany, Saudi Arabia and the UK.We recommend the following tips to reduce the risk of falling victim to a stalker: [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"

How to configure basic Firewall settings in a Windows Profile Firewall Settings allows the users to set the parameters of Firewall Components. Step 1: Go to ITSM > ‘CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES’ -> ‘Profiles’. Step 2: Click ‘Create’ icon and choose the ‘Create Windows Profile’ from the drop-down menu. Step 3: Enter the Name, Description of the profile and click the ‘Create’ button. Step 4: Click ‘Add Profile Section’ and choose ‘Firewall’ from the drop-down.  Step 5: Click ‘Confirm’ button. Note: There are some necessary settings to be completed to continue further on advanced firewall profile such as: Step 6: Fill the form loads from ‘Firewall Settings’ tab. Explanation: 1. Enable Firewall (recommended) – Enables firewall which filters inbound and outbound traffic. i. Custom ruleset – Firewall protect the endpoint based on the user rulesets (Described in Application Rules). ii. Safe mode – Application access connection based on the Comodo ratings and suppose a new application’ access is found then you will be prompted whether trust the application and allow the connection or not. iii. Training mode – Automatically creates the ruleset based on the application behavior (Monitors the network connection and resource of the connection). 2. Show popup alerts – You get alerted when the firewall find new request. If you would like to hand over the decision to Comodo then Disable the option and use the “Auto action” option as follows. 3. Auto action: i. Allow Request – Allows requests automatically if the connection is trusted. ii. Block Request – Blocks requests automatically if the connection is not trusted. 4. Turn traffic animation effects on – CIS on the endpoint displays an animation icon for incoming (yellow down arrow) and outgoing (green up arrow) connection. Hence to the endpoint to do so, you will have to keep the option enabled. If you don’t want the effect on the endpoint then disable the option. 5. Create rules for safe applications – There are three set of activities that are followed by Comodo to rule the application as trusted. The activities are checks the files at ‘Trusted File’ list, checks the vendor at ‘Trusted Software Vendor’ list, and constantly Updated Comodo Safelist. Hence CIS start analyzing and reconsider the safe application rules. 6. Set alert frequency level – Sets a number of alerts of Comodo generate. i. Very High – shows each request individually (separate alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols on specific ports and for specific IP addresses, for an application) ii. High – Shows separate alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols on specific ports for an application. iii. Medium – Shows alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols for an application. iv. Low – Shows incoming and outgoing connection requests for an application. v. Very Low – shows one alert for an application. 7. Set new on-screen alert timeout to (sec.) – Allows to set amount of time the alert should stay on the endpoint. 8. Filter IPv6 traffic – filter IPv6 network traffic. 9. Filter loopback traffic (e.g. 127.x.x.x, ::1) – filter traffic sent through loopback channel (http://localhost). 10. Block fragmented IP traffic – If the data are larger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) while transferring b/w two computers then the data are divided into smaller (fragmentation) and which are sent separately. Hence the packets can create threats and can double the amount of time it takes for single packet transfer and which cause your download speed gets slow down. 11. Do protocol analysis – checks every packet conforms to that protocols standards. 12. Enable anti-ARP spoofing – If enabled, blocks requests of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache. Step 7: Click ‘Save’ button once you have completed the setup on the ‘Firewall Settings’ tab. Step 8: Click ‘Profiles’ menu and check whether the profile has been added to the table.

How to configure basic Firewall settings in a Windows Profile Firewall Settings allows the users to set the parameters of Firewall Components. Step 1: Go to ITSM > ‘CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES’ -> ‘Profiles’. Step 2: Click ‘Create’ icon and choose the ‘Create Windows Profile’ from the drop-down menu. Step 3: Enter the Name, Description of the profile and click the ‘Create’ button. Step 4: Click ‘Add Profile Section’ and choose ‘Firewall’ from the drop-down.  Step 5: Click ‘Confirm’ button. Note: There are some necessary settings to be completed to continue further on advanced firewall profile such as: Step 6: Fill the form loads from ‘Firewall Settings’ tab. Explanation: 1. Enable Firewall (recommended) – Enables firewall which filters inbound and outbound traffic. i. Custom ruleset – Firewall protect the endpoint based on the user rulesets (Described in Application Rules). ii. Safe mode – Application access connection based on the Comodo ratings and suppose a new application’ access is found then you will be prompted whether trust the application and allow the connection or not. iii. Training mode – Automatically creates the ruleset based on the application behavior (Monitors the network connection and resource of the connection). 2. Show popup alerts – You get alerted when the firewall find new request. If you would like to hand over the decision to Comodo then Disable the option and use the “Auto action” option as follows. 3. Auto action: i. Allow Request – Allows requests automatically if the connection is trusted. ii. Block Request – Blocks requests automatically if the connection is not trusted. 4. Turn traffic animation effects on – CIS on the endpoint displays an animation icon for incoming (yellow down arrow) and outgoing (green up arrow) connection. Hence to the endpoint to do so, you will have to keep the option enabled. If you don’t want the effect on the endpoint then disable the option. 5. Create rules for safe applications – There are three set of activities that are followed by Comodo to rule the application as trusted. The activities are checks the files at ‘Trusted File’ list, checks the vendor at ‘Trusted Software Vendor’ list, and constantly Updated Comodo Safelist. Hence CIS start analyzing and reconsider the safe application rules. 6. Set alert frequency level – Sets a number of alerts of Comodo generate. i. Very High – shows each request individually (separate alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols on specific ports and for specific IP addresses, for an application) ii. High – Shows separate alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols on specific ports for an application. iii. Medium – Shows alerts for outgoing and incoming connection requests for both TCP and UDP protocols for an application. iv. Low – Shows incoming and outgoing connection requests for an application. v. Very Low – shows one alert for an application. 7. Set new on-screen alert timeout to (sec.) – Allows to set amount of time the alert should stay on the endpoint. 8. Filter IPv6 traffic – filter IPv6 network traffic. 9. Filter loopback traffic (e.g. 127.x.x.x, ::1) – filter traffic sent through loopback channel (http://localhost). 10. Block fragmented IP traffic – If the data are larger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) while transferring b/w two computers then the data are divided into smaller (fragmentation) and which are sent separately. Hence the packets can create threats and can double the amount of time it takes for single packet transfer and which cause your download speed gets slow down. 11. Do protocol analysis – checks every packet conforms to that protocols standards. 12. Enable anti-ARP spoofing – If enabled, blocks requests of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache. Step 7: Click ‘Save’ button once you have completed the setup on the ‘Firewall Settings’ tab. Step 8: Click ‘Profiles’ menu and check whether the profile has been added to the table. How to create firewall application rules in a Windows profile Application Rules allows the users to add or modify or remove Custom ruleset for firewall settings. Step 1: Go to ITSM > ‘CONFIGURATION TEMPLATES’ > ‘Profiles’.  Step 2: Click ‘Create’ icon and choose the ‘Create Windows Profile’ from the drop-down menu. Step 3: Enter the Name, Description of the profile and click the ‘Create’ button. Step 4: Click ‘Add Profile Section’ and choose ‘Firewall’ from the drop-down. Step 5: Click the ‘Confirm’ button.  Note: There are some necessary settings to be completed to continue further on advanced firewall profile such as: Step 6: Select the ‘Application Rules’ tab. Step 7: Click ‘Add’ button and Fill the form ‘Application Rule’ if you want to add more application rules. Otherwise leave the setting as in the beginning. Step 8: Choose the choice ‘using existing target’ or ‘using new target’. Enter the name if you would like to create a new file group target. Choose the choice ‘using existing target’ or ‘using new target’. If you would like to use existing target then click the ‘Browser ‘drop-down and choose the specific option from there. Step 9: There are two possible options to continue further with adding new ruleset. Choose the option ‘Use ruleset’ or ‘Use a custom ruleset’ from the form. Use ruleset – Predefined ruleset by Comodo. Use a custom ruleset – Custom ruleset which can be set by the user (you). If you would like to create a predefined ruleset, click the ‘Use ruleset’ radio button. Options: 1. Web Browser – All applications belongs to browse the internet, Example: IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and etc. 2. Email Client – All applications belongs to email client interface, Example: Thunderbird, and etc. 3. FTP Client – All applications belongs to FTP interface, Example: FileZilla, and so on. 4. Allowed Application – All applications which are set to be allowed. 5. Blocked Application – All applications which are set to be blocked. 6. Outgoing Only – All applications which are set to be allowed for outgoing connection. Choose application category from the drop down and click O’K ‘button. If you would like to copy from the existing rulesets, click the ‘Use a custom ruleset’ radio button and click ‘Copy from…’ drop-down. Options: Ruleset – Helps to copy from desired existing predefined rulesets. Another Application – Helps to copy from desired existing user-defined rulesets. If you want to use predefined Ruleset then choose Ruleset from the ‘Copy from…’ drop-down. Choose desired predefined ruleset from the drop-down. Example: Web Browser. Explanation: From the table, you can add or remove rules or you can modify a specific rule from the table. If you want to add rules then click ‘Add Rule’ button. Fill the Firewall Rule form and click ‘OK’ button to submit .  Explanation: 1. Action – Allows setting the action that firewall would take over the rule. a. Allow – If chosen, which allows the connection. b. Block – If chosen, which blocks the connection. c. Ask – If chosen, which asks you (user) to confirm the connection to be allowed or blocked. 2. Log as Firewall event if this rule is fired – Enabled or disabled for logging the event into Firewall Events when it is triggered. a. Protocol – Allows setting the type of protocol for the rule. b. TCP – If chosen, the rule applied only for TCP connection. c. UDP – If chosen, the rule applied only for UDP connection. d. TCP or UDP – If chosen, the rule applied only for TCP or UDP connection. e. ICMP – If chosen, the rule applied only to ICMP connection. f. IP – If chosen, the rule applied only for IP connection. 3. Direction – Allows setting the direction of the connection a. In – Incoming connection. b. Out – Outgoing connection. c. In or Out – Either Incoming or Outgoing connection. 4. Description – Allows describing the rule. 5. Source Address – Allows you to apply the rule for the Address of the device that tries to access your endpoint. 6. Destination Address – Allows you to apply the rule for the Address of the device that your endpoint tries to access it. Options: Exclude – If enabled, allows to set up devices to be excluded from the rule  Type – Types of the Address of the device Any address – any devices Hostname – device that has the same name of hostname IPv4 address range – device from the range of IP addresses IPv4 single address – device from the same IP address IPv4 subnet mask – device from the same subnet mask IPv6 single address – device from the same IP address IPv6 subnet mask – device from the same subnet mask MAC address – device that has the same MAC address Network zone – device that belongs the same network zone Source Port – Allows you to apply the rule for the port number or ranges of the device that tries to access your endpoint Destination Port – Allows you to apply the rule for the port number or ranges of the device that your endpoint tries to access it Options: Exclude – If enabled, allows [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information </s>"
"Lenovo issued a security bulletin Friday warning customers of two previously disclosed critical Broadcom vulnerabilities impact 25 models of its popular ThinkPad laptops. Lenovo warned customers on Friday that two critical Broadcom vulnerabilities impacts 25 models of its popular ThinkPad brand. The vulnerabilities were first revealed in September and originally they were only reported to impact specific Broadcom chipsets used in Apple iPhones, Apple TV and Android devices. Lenovo has expanded that list to include two dozen ThinkPads that use Broadcom’s BCM4356 Wireless LAN Driver for Windows 10. According to the Lenovo advisory, the Wi-Fi chipsets contain the same firmware vulnerabilities CVE-2017-11120 and CVE-2017-11121 patched by Apple and Google in September. Both vulnerabilities are tied to controllers used by Broadcom’s wireless LAN driver that contain buffer overflow flaws, which can be exploited by an attacker that can gain arbitrary code execution on the adapter, but not the targeted system’s CPU.  Both CVEs are rated “critical” and have scores of 10 on Mitre’s CVSS scale. The CVE-2017-11120 vulnerability was first identified by Google Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini in June and disclosed publicly in September as a proof-of-concept bug report. “Upon successful execution of the exploit, a backdoor is inserted into the firmware, allowing remote read/write commands to be issued to the firmware via crafted action frames (thus allowing easy remote control over the Wi-Fi chip),” Beniamini said. The vulnerability lives in Broadcom chips used by Apple in the iPhone and other products, including tvOS used in Apple TV, and watchOS used in the Apple Watch. Android also makes use of the same chips, and Google patched the bug in the September Android Security Bulletin. As for CVE-2017-11121, that vulnerability was also discovered by Beniamini and is a buffer overflow vulnerability caused by improper validation of Wi-Fi signals. “Properly crafted malicious over-the-air Fast Transition frames can potentially trigger internal Wi-Fi firmware heap and/or stack overflows, leading to denial of service or other effects,” according to researchers. The vulnerability also impacted Apple’s iOS and tvOS along with Google’s Android OS. Patches were issued for the vulnerability in September. Lenovo is recommending affected ThinkPad customers update their Wi-Fi driver versions. Affected ThinkPad SKUs are: ThinkPad 10,  ThinkPad L460, ThinkPad P50s, ThinkPad T460, ThinkPad T460p, ThinkPad T460s, ThinkPad T560, ThinkPad X260 and ThinkPad Yoga 260. : Mobile Security Vulnerabilities","T1055 Process Injection,T1021 Remote Services,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] Lenovo issued a security bulletin Friday warning customers of two previously disclosed critical Broadcom vulnerabilities impact 25 models of its popular ThinkPad laptops.

"Schneider Electric on Tuesday issued fixes for a vulnerability its SoMachine Basic software that could result in disclosure and retrieval of arbitrary data. Schneider Electric on Tuesday issued fixes for a vulnerability in its SoMachine Basic software, which could result in the disclosure and retrieval of arbitrary data. The software in question is used to develop code for programmable logic controllers. Attackers can leverage a vulnerability within the XML parser tool within SoMachine Basic, and launch an out-of-band remote arbitrary data retrieval attack. “SoMachine Basic suffers from an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability using the DTD parameter entities technique, resulting in disclosure and retrieval of arbitrary data on the affected node via out-of-band (OOB) attack,” Schnieder Electric said in a security notice. “The vulnerability is triggered when input passed to the xml parser is not sanitized while parsing the xml project/template file.” Essentially, it means that several versions of SoMachine Basic have sites that accept XML documents as input. When an XML document is received, it needs to be parsed, which means turning it from a text file into structured data. “The tools out there that do that are called XML parsers, and it turns out that in the XML spec, there’s support for features like adding a header in the doc, enabling the person creating the document to reference external documents or files,” explained Jeff Williams, CTO of Contrast Security, speaking to Threatpost. Williams said an attacker could create a malicious XML file and upload it to this site, but when the XML parser reads this file, it also reads the malicious header that the attacker added, and attempts to bring in the external resource – which could be reference files on the disk, or other file servers on the networks. “So an attacker could upload a malicious XML file, [and then] it pulls in resources from the disk, and then the program leaks those details out through the website,” said Williams. “That data could be anything on the internal network – including manufacturing data or personal data. A bigger risk is [the potential for] stealing IP, source code or files related to industrial processes.”   The vulnerability (CVE-2018-7783) was rated a CVSS score of 8.6, which is considered “high,” according to Schneider Electric. However, while the vulnerability may put data at risk, SoMachine Basic is not a production ICS system, but rather in a development environment. As such, it incurs no material downtime and therefore would not have any urgency from a business perspective, according to Tom Parsons, senior director of product management at Tenable. “The attack requires… user interaction,” he told Threatpost. “The victim would have to actively load/import a malicious file crafted by an attacker. So, it’s not an easy attack to execute, because an attacker can’t just remotely connect to the system and execute the exploit.” Schneider Electric did not respond to questions from Threatpost including whether there has been an exploit of the vulnerability discovered. “The cybersecurity team at Schneider Electric has collaborated with Applied Risk to ensure the exploit had been addressed after identification with an effective patch,” a spokesperson at Applied Risk, whose researcher Gjoko Krstikj discovered the vulnerability, told Threatpost. All versions of SoMachine Basic prior to v1.6 SP1 are impacted by the flaw. The manufacturing company said a fix is available for download online, or by using the Schneider Electric Software Update tool. Schneider Electric has faced a bevy of vulnerabilities on its systems, including a critical remote code execution vulnerability in two Schneider Electric industrial control-related products in May and a critical vulnerability in its WonderWare Historian last year. But security experts like Parsons said that industrial vendors, for their part, are becoming more aware of cybersecurity vulnerabilities on their operational technology-related hardware and software. “Vulnerability types like remote service vulnerabilities are still common in OT systems, while in the IT world these have been displaced by application vulnerabilities,” Parsons told Threatpost. “This reflects that OT has only recently become a target for threat actors. But OT vendors are becoming much more aware and active in addressing vulnerabilities and providing patches, as OT becomes increasingly connected.” : Critical Infrastructure Featured Vulnerabilities","T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] Schneider Electric on Tuesday issued fixes for a vulnerability its SoMachine Basic software that could result in disclosure and retrieval of arbitrary data.

"Mozilla fixed 13 security issues, including two critical vulnerabilities that could have led to spoofing and clickjacking, among other issues, when it updated Firefox to the latest build, Firefox 47, this week. Mozilla fixed 13 security issues, including two critical vulnerabilities that could have led to spoofing and clickjacking, among other issues, when it updated Firefox to the latest build, Firefox 47, this week. One of the issues, a buffer overflow, could have resulted in a potentially exploitable crash according to an advisory published by the company on Tuesday. According a security researcher that goes by the handle firehack, the overflow could have popped up when the browser parsed HTML5 fragments in a foreign context. When a fragment was inserted into an existing document, it could’ve crashed the browser. The second critical issue corresponds to not one, but several memory safety bugs reported by 14 different Mozilla developers and community members. The details of the bugs weren’t revealed, but according to the advisory the likeliness that some could be exploited to run arbitrary code was high enough that it warranted fixing. A handful of vulnerabilities branded high by the company were also fixed in Firefox this week, including two out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities and two use-after-free vulnerabilities. If exploited they could lead to privilege escalation, a potential crash, and persistent denial of service attacks, to name a few outcomes. In addition to the DoS attack, an attacker would be able to manipulate pointerlock, a web API, so that it could lead to spoofing and clickjacking attacks, Mozilla warns. Firefox 47 also switches all NPAPI plugins, other than Flash, to click-to-activate by default. The whitelist plugin has been expired in the eyes of Mozilla developers for a while now. Mozilla previously announced plans to completely remove support for NPAPI plugins in Firefox by the end of 2016.

Mozilla fixed 13 security issues, including two critical vulnerabilities that could have led to spoofing and clickjacking, among other issues, when it updated Firefox to the latest build, Firefox 47, this week. One of the issues, a buffer overflow, could have resulted in a potentially exploitable crash according to an advisory published by the company on Tuesday. According a security researcher that goes by the handle firehack, the overflow could have popped up when the browser parsed HTML5 fragments in a foreign context. When a fragment was inserted into an existing document, it could’ve crashed the browser. The second critical issue corresponds to not one, but several memory safety bugs reported by 14 different Mozilla developers and community members. The details of the bugs weren’t revealed, but according to the advisory the likeliness that some could be exploited to run arbitrary code was high enough that it warranted fixing. A handful of vulnerabilities branded high by the company were also fixed in Firefox this week, including two out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities and two use-after-free vulnerabilities. If exploited they could lead to privilege escalation, a potential crash, and persistent denial of service attacks, to name a few outcomes. In addition to the DoS attack, an attacker would be able to manipulate pointerlock, a web API, so that it could lead to spoofing and clickjacking attacks, Mozilla warns. Firefox 47 also switches all NPAPI plugins, other than Flash, to click-to-activate by default. The whitelist plugin has been expired in the eyes of Mozilla developers for a while now. Mozilla previously announced plans to completely remove support for NPAPI plugins in Firefox by the end of 2016.

"After someone dropped a zero-day exploit on Securelist this week, the platform rushed out a fix — time to apply it. A critical remote code execution (RCE) bug affecting default 5.x versions of vBulletin (CVE-2019-16759) is being actively exploited in the wild, allowing unauthenticated attackers to take control of web hosts. A zero-day proof-of-concept code was anonymously published on Monday, ahead of vBulletin issuing a patch. Also, Tenable vice president of intelligence Gavin Millard said via email that there is now a script to leverage Shodan and mass identify thousands of vulnerable systems. Bug Details A successful exploit would allow an attacker to take control of a site using vBulletin, a popular platform for powering online forums and communities. According to Sucuri researcher Marc-Alexandre Montpas, the bug is caused by a flaw in vBulletin’s PHP widgets, which are rendered at runtime and used to create dynamic widgets without having to directly access the hosting server. “The researcher found a way to force the site to render arbitrary widgets using the ajax/render/widget_php route,” he explained in a blog post this week. “Since the evalCode callback does exactly what you think it does, essentially running eval on the code it is fed, this makes it possible to run arbitrary code on the underlying server.” Tenable Research analysis showed that an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the issue by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to a vulnerable vBulletin host and execute commands. “These commands would be executed with the permissions of the user account that the vBulletin service is utilizing,” said Tenable researcher Ryan Seguin, in the analysis. “Depending on the service user’s permissions, this could allow complete control of a host….the published exploit code returns its successful execution in a JSON formatted response.” The fix is for versions 5.5.2, 5.5.3 and 5.5.4; users on earlier versions of vBulletin 5.x will need to update to one of the currently supported versions in order to apply the patch. The fix has also been applied to the cloud version of the platform. Administrators should apply the patch as soon as possible. Montpas warned, “This vulnerability is extremely severe. It allows any website visitors to run PHP code and shell commands on the site’s underlying server. As if it wasn’t bad enough, this bug doesn’t require the attacker to have any kind of privilege to conduct a successful attack. vBulletin’s default settings also make the vulnerable endpoint accessible by default.” Attacks in the Wild Sucuri and Tenable telemetry has identified a rash of attacks already taking place in the wild, just days after the PoC was dropped on Securelist. “The payload attackers are using is very interesting: It essentially modifies the vulnerable snippet by adding a password validation,” Montpas noted. “This is a way for attackers to maintain access to sites they’ve hacked for themselves, as well as lock out other potential hackers from getting in. From this point, the bad actor can use his newly acquired site to do other malicious things in the future.” To find out if a site has been compromised, the researcher said to look for “ajax/render/widget_php” in the access logs. That’s because some of the parameters used in the attacks can be located on POST requests, which wouldn’t leave any traces in the logs. Mike Bittner, associate director of Digital Security and Operations at The Media Trust, said that it was just a matter of time before bad actors fixed their crosshairs on forums, which are rich storehouses of user information. “The argument that many of today’s sites do not collect users’ information betrays a very uninformed notion of how websites work,” he said via email. “Most, if not all, of today’s websites are built using a vendor’s platform. If you’re a small business, you probably don’t have the time or the money to build your own platform. If you’re a medium-sized or large organization, you don’t have the time or money to build a platform with all the bells and whistles users have come to expect. Forums are just one example. Unfortunately, vendors that supply these features too often collect information on users without site owners’ authorization, while failing to equip their products with the needed security and privacy protections, leaving website owners to fend for themselves and shoulder the blame for any data breaches involving their sites. In an environment where bad actors are always looking out for vulnerabilities they can exploit or well-intentioned products like vBulletin they can abuse, site owners will need to close the security gaps themselves–ideally by carefully vetting their vendors and ensuring those vendors observe digital policies.” What are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

"Facebook said it will double bug bounty payouts for the remainder of the year for serious vulnerabilities in its ad code. Popular segments of Facebook code have plenty of white—and black hats—poking around for bugs. The same probably cannot be said for the social network’s ads code, so Facebook has decided to add an incentive to its bug bounty program. Through the end of the year, payments will be doubled for bugs reported to and verified by the bounty program, Facebook said. “We recently completed a comprehensive security audit of this area ourselves. We found and fixed a number of security bugs but would like to encourage additional scrutiny from Whitehats to see what we might have missed,” said Facebook security engineer Collin Greene. “We hope to encourage researchers to become more familiar with the surface area of ads to better protect the businesses that use them.” Ad code largely handles roles and enforces permissions, and also permission for reading or writing billing information, Facebook said. Greene said that a number of ad code vulnerabilities have passed through the bounty program, but not enough to think that commodity vulnerabilities have been conquered as they have in other regions of Facebook code. “At this stage of our bug bounty program, it’s uncommon for us to see many of the common web security bugs like XSS [cross-site scripting],” Greene said. “What we see more often are things like missing or incorrect permissions checks, insufficient rate-limiting that can lead to scraping, edge-case CSRF issues , and problems with SWFs.” Facebook identified a number of areas that are in scope for an ads bounty. The user interface, which includes the Ads Manager and Power Editor tools that enable users to edit and upload bulk ads, has been a place where a number of permissions-based security issues have been discovered and reported. Also, the Ads API is an area Facebook hopes for some white hat scrutiny. In July, a serious privacy bug in the API was reported that allowed legacy REST API calls to be made on behalf of any user. Exploiting this bug could expose private messages, notes, drafts, contact information and provided access to post an updated status, comments, create photo albums and upload photos and more, according to researcher Stephen Sclafani. Facebook’s ads Analytics feature, used to measure ad performance, is another spot where permissions-based vulnerabilities have been discovered. Exploits there have made analytics available for an application by using a Graph API token. Facebook’s bug bounty is three years old and has paid out more than $3 million. Earlier this year, Facebook paid out $33,500 for a remote code execution XXE vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to read files from a Facebook server to another internal service and execute code. The bug caused Facebook to disable external entities across and audit the code for similar endpoints. Today’s announcement around ads code was hinted at in April when Facebook announced that it might increase rewards for critical bugs after studying 2013 submissions. Facebook paid out more than a million dollars in bounties in 2013 to 330 white hats; overall submissions, however, including those ineligible for a bounty jumped 246 percent. “The volume of high-severity issues is down, and we’re hearing from researchers that it’s tougher to find good bugs,” Greene said at the time. “To encourage the best research in the most valuable areas, we’re going to continue increasing our reward amounts for high priority issues.” : Vulnerabilities","T1082 System Information Discovery,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job","<s>[INST] Facebook said it will double bug bounty payouts for the remainder of the year for serious vulnerabilities in its ad code.

"A criminal posing as a legitimate website publisher on the AdsTerra online advertising network is using maliciously gathered traffic to deliver victims to exploit kits. UPDATE A sprawling malvertising campaign that leverages the AdsTerra legitimate online advertising company has been uncovered, involving at least 10,000 compromised websites and driving legions of web visitors around the world to exploit kits. AdsTerra, one of the largest ad networks out there, essentially acts as a middle man, brokering deals between website publishers offering ad space and advertisers offering the highest bids for that online real estate. Often the winning advertising bidder for the space will resell that ad inventory to smaller advertisers, making for a multi-level economic model that a malvertising mastermind known as Master134 has been able to take advantage of. Check Point researchers have found that Master134 has been posing as a legitimate website publisher on the AdsTerra online advertising network. To make its ad space attractive to advertisers, Master134 has ballooned its traffic by compromising 10,000 WordPress sites (all of them running the vulnerable 4.7.1 version of the software); thanks to that compromise campaign, visitors to those sites are redirected to Master134’s site. Once victims reach Master134’s IP address, they’re in turn redirected to the ad pages that Master134 has sold via the AdsTerra platform using the artificially pumped up traffic. The truly malicious part is that the ads are all redirecting site visitors to malware-download pages, which are distributing banking trojans, ransomware and bots on a drive-by basis. Check Point’s investigation revealed that legitimate resellers were bidding on ad space offered by the actor via AdsTerra, including ExoClick, EvoLeads and AdventureFeeds. Yet threat actors were purchasing the resold traffic. “An examination of the purchases from AdsTerra showed that somehow, space offered by Master134 always ended up in the hands of cybercriminals, and thus enables the infection chain to be completed,” Check Point researchers explained, in a posting on Monday about the operation. They added, “The list of redirection chains includes major players in the exploit kit landscape, along with some other malicious sites: Fobos, HookAds, Seamless, BowMan, TorchLie, BlackTDS and Slyip, all redirect to the Rig Exploit Kit. In addition, redirections to Magnitude Exploit Kit, GrandSoft Exploit Kit, FakeFlash and technical support scams can also be found in the list.” Check Point also mentioned a fourth company that it identified as a reseller: AdKernel. The company however said that it had been misidentified; Check Point subsequently removed the reference from its posting upon further investigation. “While the researchers did a great job discovering fraudulent and malvertising activities, they mistakenly mentioned AdKernel as an ad network or reseller, and made an erroneous statement that our company is involved in the activities of serving bad-actor advertisers,” AdKernel told Threatpost. “AdKernel is a leading white-label ad-serving technology company to ad networks and resellers. We provide ad-serving tools (including but not limited to RTB tools, analytics, optimization algorithms and much more) to hundreds of businesses around the world.” Threatpost also reached out to Cyprus-based AdsTerra for more information on its verification process for advertisements and publishers. It told us that all publisher accounts that were mentioned in the research have now been suspended and that it plans to review its compliance policies and monitoring software based on Check Point’s findings. “We would like to emphasize that we do not accept traffic from hacked/hijacked sites,” the company told us. “Malware ads are prohibited in AdsTerra Network and we have a monitor system that checks all campaigns and stops all suspicious campaigns.” There’s a caveat however: “The logs from the article demonstrate that those ads came from third-party networks which are hard to control — third-party ads served by other ad networks connected to our supply using RTB/XML protocols. We will contact the networks that were mentioned in that article and notify them of the problems discovered.” The discovery reveals an alarming subversion of the economy of the internet given that a tool with as large a reach as AdsTerra has been purchasing traffic from a known cybercriminal posing as an ordinary publisher, which obtains its traffic via malicious activities. “Based on our findings, we speculate that the threat actors pay Master134 directly,” researchers explained. “Master134 then pays the ad-network companies to re-route and perhaps even disguise the origins of the traffic. In such a scenario, Master134 plays a unique role in the cybercrime underworld; he is generating profit from ad revenue by working directly with AdsTerra and is successfully making sure this traffic reaches the right, or in our case – the wrong hands.” Master134 is a known player in the underground economy of cybercrime, according to researchers. “Malicious campaigns dating back to 2016 have been traced to Master134’s IP address, and correspond with the timing of a previous malicious campaign linked to AdTerra,” Chris Olson, CEO of the Media Trust, said via email. “That year, Master134 redirected unsuspecting internet users from legitimate to malicious sites. These earlier campaigns seem to have paid off, and has enabled the miscreant to form a massive, highly organized operation with other known bad actors, as well as ad industry players who had previously looked away but now appear to be actively aiding and abetting traffic fraud.” Unfortunately, lack of transparency in the digital supply chain combined with the millions of internet users at the receiving end of digital ads have turned traffic fraud into a lucrative multi-billion dollar business and, therefore, entice crime and corruption, he added. “To combat traffic fraud, all digital players should police their digital partners and the code those partners execute in their digital ecosystem; ensure partners are adequately secure from malicious attacks; and continuously scan their digital ecosystems in real-time to identify and, when needed, terminate unauthorized code,” he noted.

"Google patched a hole in its Gmail verification system last week that allowed an attacker to hijack a targeted Google Gmail account. Google patched a hole in its Gmail verification system last week that allowed an attacker to hijack a targeted Google Gmail account. The discovery was made by Ahmed Mehtab, a security researcher and founder of Security Fuse. The hack is simple to execute and requires less than dozen steps to pull off. The hack exploits an authentication or verification bypass vulnerability in a Gmail feature that allows you to send email from a second Gmail account. Mehtab said the attack is “similar to account takeover but here I — as an attacker — can hijack email addresses by confirming the ownership of email (account).” Exploiting the hack, an attacker can send email as if it was being sent from the compromised account. In addition, the attacker could have email forwarded to the compromised Gmail address. The hack has one big prerequisite, however. The Gmail account targeted for hijacking must either be blocking emails sent from the attacker’s account, or be deactivated or be tied to a nonexistent Gmail account. Under these scenarios, Mehtab was able to send email as google@gmail.com and gmail@gmail.com. Google confirmed with Threatpost both the vulnerability and  fixing the flaw. What the attack did not appear to allow Mehtab to do, based on a technical description of the hack posted by Mehtab, is access the contents of the targeted Gmail account or access related Google Account services such as Google Drive, Photos and Play where personal and financial information is stored. The hack is tied to the way Google handles linking a primary Gmail account to another email address to allow the function of message forwarding and using email aliases. In a video, above, Mehtab shows how he was able to trick Google into adding an email account to an existing account. To pull off the hack, Mehtab first went to his Gmail’s Settings menu and selected the “Send Mail As” option and selecting the “Use Gmail to send from your other email addresses” and select “Treat as an alias.” From here, as the video shows, Mehtab forces Google to send a verification email to add the Gmail address to his account to the nonexistent Gmail address that delivers a bounce back email message. Now Mehtab can access that bounce back message and pluck out the verification code number and successfully add the account to his Gmail account. “Any Gmail address which is associated or connected with Gmail’s SMTP was vulnerable to this security issue,” Mehtab wrote. That includes @gmail.com, @googlemail.com or @googleemail.com, according to Mehtab. “There is a scenario where attacker can trick victim in deactivating his account or attacker can also trick victim in blocking his email address,” he said. “Once he does that we can hijack his email address easily.” Mehtab disclosed the bug to Google on Oct. 20. Google addressed the flaw the same day. On Nov. 1, Google added the bug to its “Hall of Fame,” according to Mehtab. “One of the sad part in this research is that, i was not rewarded for such a serious security issue but they acknowledged my research and listed me in Hall of fame,” he noted in his blog outlining his research. : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security",T1566 Phishing,"<s>[INST] Google patched a hole in its Gmail verification system last week that allowed an attacker to hijack a targeted Google Gmail account. Google patched a hole in its Gmail verification system last week that allowed an attacker to hijack a targeted Google Gmail account. The discovery was made by Ahmed Mehtab, a security researcher and founder of Security Fuse. The hack is simple to execute and requires less than dozen steps to pull off. The hack exploits an authentication or verification bypass vulnerability in a Gmail feature that allows you to send email from a second Gmail account. Mehtab said the attack is “similar to account takeover but here I — as an attacker — can hijack email addresses by confirming the ownership of email (account).” Exploiting the hack, an attacker can send email as if it was being sent from the compromised account. In addition, the attacker could have email forwarded to the compromised Gmail address. The hack has one big prerequisite, however. The Gmail account targeted for hijacking must either be blocking emails sent from the attacker’s account, or be deactivated or be tied to a nonexistent Gmail account. Under these scenarios, Mehtab was able to send email as google@gmail.com and gmail@gmail.com. Google confirmed with Threatpost both the vulnerability and  fixing the flaw.

"Microsoft released patches on Tuesday for unsupported versions of Windows, a decision prompted by three NSA exploits that remained unaddressed from April’s ShadowBrokers leak. The unusual decision Microsoft made to release patches on Tuesday for unsupported versions of Windows was prompted by three NSA exploits that remained unaddressed from April’s ShadowBrokers leak. The worst of the bunch, an attack called ExplodingCan (CVE-2017-7269), targets older versions of Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) webserver, version 6.0 in particular, and enables an attacker to gain remote code execution on a Windows 2003 server. All three attacks allow an adversary to gain remote code execution; one is EsteemAudit, a vulnerability in the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) (CVE-2017-0176), while the other is EnglishmanDentist (CVE-2017-8487), a bug in OLE (Object Linking and Embedding). Microsoft said the patches are available for manual download. ExplodingCan merits a closer look because of the wide deployment of IIS 6.0. “Generally, when you put a Windows machine on the internet, it’s going to be a server and it’s going to run a webserver, so there are production machines on the internet running IIS 6.0 right now,” said Sean Dillon, senior analyst at RiskSense and one of the first to analyze the NSA’s EternalBlue exploit that spread WannaCry ransomware on May 12. “It’s probably already been exploited for months now,” Dillon said. “At least now there’s a fix that’s publicly available.” Microsoft released a hefty load of patches for supported products and services on Tuesday as part of its normal Patch Tuesday update cycle. Normally, patches for unsupported versions of Windows are available only for Microsoft customers on an expensive extended support contract. The company’s decision to make all of those fixes public on Tuesday, it said, was prompted by an elevated risk for “destructive cyber attacks.” “Due to the elevated risk for destructive cyber attacks at this time, we made the decision to take this action because applying these updates provides further protection against potential attacks with characteristics similar to WannaCrypt,” said Adrienne Hall, general manager of Microsoft’s Cyber Defense Operations Center. “In reviewing the updates for this month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyber attacks by government organizations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors or other copycat organizations,” Hall said. “To address this risk, today we are providing additional security updates along with our regular Update Tuesday service. These security updates are being made available to all customers, including those using older versions of Windows.” The ShadowBrokers’ leak in April unleashed a number of powerful Windows attacks into the public, allegedly belonging to the Equation Group, which is widely believed to the U.S. National Security Agency. Criminals and other nation states have already been leveraging the attacks to spread not only WannaCry ransomware, but also crytpocurrency mining utilities and other types of malware. Microsoft said customers should not expect this type of patch release for unsupported products to become the norm. Some experts have been critical of Microsot, which also made a similar update available for unsupported products hours after the WannaCry outbreak. “It was the right move by Microsoft,” Dillon said. “We saw the damage it can cause with WannaCry. “Some of the most-used infrastructure, like SCADA systems, still run on XP whether they’re getting patches or not. When you have critical things [running on XP], it’s a good thing they released, but it should only be looked at as a temporary solution and people should look to upgrade off of legacy versions.” Some third-party services such as 0patch have provided micro-patches for some of these vulnerabilities on legacy versions, even before the ShadowBrokers leak, Dillon said. “Hopefully people who are running legacy systems have looked into other means of patching beside official fixes,” he said. “Although, this is great that there’s an official fix.” The remaining two vulnerabilities are a lesser severity but should be patched nonetheless on legacy systems. EsteemAudit affects RDP, but only on XP and did not require a patch for modern versions of Windows. According to Microsoft, the vulnerability exists if the RDP server has smart card authentication enabled. EnglishmanDentist, meanwhile, is triggered because Windows OLE fails to properly validate user input, Microsoft said. “There’s a whole wide assortment of exploits that were leaked, and we’ve only seen a few of them actively used at a mass scale. This is just plugging a hole before it becomes a bigger problem,” Dillon said. : Vulnerabilities","T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Microsoft released patches on Tuesday for unsupported versions of Windows, a decision prompted by three NSA exploits that remained unaddressed from April’s ShadowBrokers leak.

"Overall, the company released only three patches as part of its regularly-scheduled November update. Adobe on Tuesday released three patches – including a fix for a flaw in Adobe Acrobat and Reader that exposes hashed passwords that already has a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code publicly available. The information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2018-15979, exists in Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and was reported by the EdgeSpot team. “Successful exploitation could lead to an inadvertent leak of the user’s hashed NTLM password,” said Adobe, in its release. NTLM is the authentication protocol used on networks that include systems running the Windows operating system and on standalone systems. While no further information about the PoC was revealed, Adobe said the attack allows bad actors to redirect a user to a malicious resource outside their organization to obtain the NTLM authentication messages. The vulnerability is “important” in severity, and the update has a “Priority 1” rating, meaning that it “resolves vulnerabilities being targeted, or which have a higher risk of being targeted, by exploit(s) in the wild for a given product version and platform,” according to Adobe. Impacted versions include Acrobat DC and Reader DC 2019.008.20080 and earlier versions; Acrobat Classic and Reader Classic 2017.011.30105 and earlier versions; and Acrobat DC Classic and Acrobat Reader DC Classic 2015.006.30456 and earlier versions. Overall, only three patches were released as part of Adobe’s regularly-scheduled November update – compared to last month’s 47. All three fix information-disclosure issues. One of these updates addresses a flaw in Adobe Flash Player. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-15978, exists in Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime, Adobe Flash Player for Google Chrome and Adobe Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11 – all versions 31.0.0.122 and earlier. “These updates address an important vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player 31.0.0.122 and earlier versions,” said Adobe in its update. “Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure.” Finally, the company released an update for an “important” flaw in Adobe Photoshop CC for Windows and MacOS. That flaw, CVE- 2018-15980, exists in Photoshop CC 19.1.6 and earlier 19.x versions. It was discovered by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative. These other two fixes released were also rated “important.” However, Adobe said that it was not aware of any exploits existing that relate to these vulnerabilities. : Vulnerabilities Web Security",T1003 OS Credential Dumping,"<s>[INST] Overall, the company released only three patches as part of its regularly-scheduled November update.

But Utah isn’t alone and finds itself on a podium along with major IT hubs like California and New York, according to a new analysis by the Comodo Threat Research Labs that identifies which states are homes to the most spam sent. Part of the Comodo Threat Research Labs’ offerings is filtering email to protect customers from malware, spam, spyware, Trojans and other harmful cyberattacks and to keep their endpoints secure.  The engineers at Comodo studied all of the email they filtered for customers in the second half of 2015, specifically looking at spam, and conducted an IP address analysis of the millions of pieces of email spam that came into the Comodo Threat Research Labs.

"AMD has fixed one high-severity vulnerability affecting its client and embedded processors; fixes for the other two will come out later in June. Three high-severity vulnerabilities have been disclosed in AMD’s client and embedded processors that came out between 2016 and 2019. An attacker with physical or privileged access to certain AMD powered systems could exploit the flaws to execute arbitrary code or take control of the firmware. AMD, which dubs the flaws “SMM Callout Privilege Escalation” bugs, released a fix for one of the three, CVE-2020–14032, on June 8. The other two flaws (CVE-2020–12890 and another that has yet to be issued a CVE number) have not yet been fixed. However, in a security update last week, AMD said it plans deliver the fixes for the issues by the end of June 2020. “AMD is aware of new research related to a potential vulnerability in AMD software technology supplied to motherboard manufacturers for use in their Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) infrastructure and plans to complete delivery of updated versions designed to mitigate the issue by the end of June 2020,” according to AMD. The three vulnerabilities were reported by security researcher Danny Odler on April 2, who then went on to publish an analysis for the patched vulnerability earlier on June 13, after it was fixed. Odler told Threatpost, no further details are available on the other two flaws as of now because they are not yet fixed. Odler said that the flaws exist on AMD’s Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) microprocessors, which are designed to act as both a CPU and GPU on a single die. He specifically tested the issue on the UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) of AMD’s Mini PC product. AMD Mini PC was released by AMD in December 2019 as a direct competitor to small form factor computing units, including Intel’s NUC and Gigabyte Brix. All three flaws exist on technology called System Management Mode (SMM). SMM is an operating mode that’s mainly responsible for CPU and chipset configurations, motherboard manufacturer code, and secured operations such as setting secure boot hashes, TPM (Trusted Platform Module) configurations and power management. SMM exists on microprocessors manufactured both by Intel and AMD. However, Odler confirmed to Threatpost that Intel NUC (which leverages SMM) is not exploitable for the same vulnerability. The root cause of the SMM vulnerability is a lack of checks on the destination buffer address when calling SmmGetVariable() in the SMI (System Management Interrupt) handler 0xEF.  The SMI 0xEF handler implements a wrapper logic for getting data to and from the UEFI variables, which then provide a way to store data that is shared between platform firmware and operating systems or UEFI applications. The SmmGetVariable function uses the ArgsStruct values to find the correct variable, read its data and store the data in a buffer – however, these ArgsStruct values are used directly “as is” without any validation, said Odler. Because of this lack of validation, “as a result [the] attacker achieves generic write primitive to the most protected memory, SMRAM, and from now code execution in SMM is a trivial task as already explained,” said Odler. “Code execution in SMM is a game over for all security boundaries such as SecureBoot, Hypervisor, VBS, Kernel and more.” The attacker would then be able to manipulate AMD’s microcode in the motherboard’s UEFI firmware. This microcode is labelled AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture (AGESA). A full proof-of-concept video is available for the attack (below). AMD, for its part, sought to downplay the attack, saying it requires privileged physical or administrative access to a system based on select AMD notebooks or embedded processors. “If this level of access is acquired, an attacker could potentially manipulate the AMD Generic Encapsulated Software Architecture (AGESA) to execute arbitrary code undetected by the operating system,” said AMD.  “AMD believes this only impacts certain client and embedded APU processors launched between 2016 and 2019. AMD has delivered the majority of the updated versions of AGESA to our motherboard partners and plans to deliver the remaining versions by the end of June 2020.” It’s only the latest AMD vulnerability. Earlier in March, researchers disclosed the “Take A Way” side channel attack that they said could leak potentially sensitivie data from AMD processors released between 2011 and 2019. “AMD recommends following the security best practice of keeping devices up-to-date with the latest patches,” said AMD. “End users with questions about whether their system is running on these latest versions should contact their motherboard or original equipment/system manufacturer.” Insider threats are different in the work-from home era.

Three high-severity vulnerabilities have been disclosed in AMD’s client and embedded processors that came out between 2016 and 2019. An attacker with physical or privileged access to certain AMD powered systems could exploit the flaws to execute arbitrary code or take control of the firmware. AMD, which dubs the flaws “SMM Callout Privilege Escalation” bugs, released a fix for one of the three, CVE-2020–14032, on June 8. The other two flaws (CVE-2020–12890 and another that has yet to be issued a CVE number) have not yet been fixed. However, in a security update last week, AMD said it plans deliver the fixes for the issues by the end of June 2020. “AMD is aware of new research related to a potential vulnerability in AMD software technology supplied to motherboard manufacturers for use in their Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) infrastructure and plans to complete delivery of updated versions designed to mitigate the issue by the end of June 2020,” according to AMD. The three vulnerabilities were reported by security researcher Danny Odler on April 2, who then went on to publish an analysis for the patched vulnerability earlier on June 13, after it was fixed.

"Joomla fixed two critical issues in the content management system and is strongly encouraging users to update their sites immediately. Web developers who run the content management system Joomla! are strongly encouraged to update their sites immediately. The company on Tuesday pushed out the most recent version of the CMS, 3.6.4, fixing two critical issues that can lead to account creation and elevated privileges, according to a release update published by the Joomla! Project. Both issues, which the company branded as high severity, were discovered earlier this month and affect versions 3.4.4 through 3.6.3. Because of inadequate checks, the account creation bug could allow a user to register as a new user when their registration has been disabled. The elevated privileges bug also tangentially deals with registration. Because of what Joomla! refers to as “incorrectly used unfiltered data,” a new user could register on the site and be granted elevated privileges. The update also remedies a two-factor authentication error that started popping up in the CMS last week. On Oct. 18, following the release of the previous version, 3.6.3, a handful of users who use 2FA reported on Joomla’s Github page being locked out of their websites. Users claim they were met with “Must match character set” error notifications and forced to remove 2FA via their site databases in order to gain access. The problem stemmed from the fact that Joomla recently upgraded to a new version of FOF, or Framework on Framework, a third party rapid application development framework for the CMS. The CMS was using FOFEncryptAesMcrypt but moved to FOFEncryptAesOpenssl with the update, making the Mcrypt keys of users invalid. In a pull request on Github, Robert Deutz, part of Joomla’s Production Leadership Team, said Joomla fixed the issue and now converts data to OpenSSL if it’s crypted with Mcrypt. According to researchers with Sucuri, who looked into the issues on Wednesday, exploits for the vulnerabilities have been spotted in the wild. Marc-Alexandre Montpas, a security researcher at the firm, looked at the code and crafted an exploit to test the company’s firewall. Montpas determined that an attacker could use the arbitrary account creation bug to override properties, like any groups a user may belong to; manager, author, admin, and so on. From there, it’s a short path to code execution. “As administrators can install extension packages on their site, an attacker could use his freshly hacked administrator account to upload a remote shell on the site and further compromise the server,” Montpas warned.

"Pentesters say a keyless smart lock made by U-tec, called Ultraloq, is neither ultra or secure. Researchers are warning a keyless smart door lock made by U-tec, called Ultraloq, could allow attackers to track down where the device is being used and easily pick the lock – either virtually or physically. Ultraloq is a Bluetooth fingerprint and touchscreen door lock sold for about $200. It allows a user to use either fingerprints or a PIN for local access to a building. Ultraloq also has an app that can be used locally or remotely for access. When Pen Test Partners, with help from researchers identified as @evstykas and @cybergibbons, took a closer look they found Ultraloq was riddled with vulnerabilities. For starters, researchers found that the application programming interface (API) used by the mobile app leaked enough personal data from the user account to determine the physical address where the Ultraloq device was being used. Researchers went one-step further and said hacking open the physical lock is trivial and “easy to pick”. According to a report released Thursday, U-tech fixed the glaring API issue. However, the keyless lock maker has not address a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) issue that allows attacker to easily crack the lock open with a brute force credential attack. Pen Test Partners said that U-tech has not warned customers of the risk of bypassing the mechanical back-up lock. “Not great U-tec, not great,” researchers wrote. Compromising the multiple layers of security tied to the Ultraloq began with cracking BLE security key. Brute Forcing BLE Encryption Key The BLE key is constructed and operates in two parts, researchers explained. One part is a token obtained from the lock. And the second is static salt protection of credential data. “These parts (token and static salt) are concatenated together to produce a 16 octet byte array, the appropriate size for an AES key,” researchers said. “The static salt can be obtained from the app and is equivalent to the string.” Next, the token is obtained by querying the BLE characteristics with a universally unique identifier (UUID). “As the code for the lock is a 6 digit integer, this makes it possible to attempt a brute force attack against the lock through the BLE interface,” the researcher stated. From BLE to Worse An additional weakness was identified in the API’s lack of authentication. “[The] API has no authentication at all,” researchers wrote. “The data is obfuscated by being base64 twice but decoding it exposes that the server side has no authentication or authorization logic. This leads to an attacker being able to get data and impersonate all the users,” researchers wrote. This could lead to a full compromise of all Ultraloq locks that are connected to the cloud service, they said. Researchers added the vulnerability opened the door for an attacker to retrieve the BLE encryption key and potentially all the users PINs. “The easiest way to a full compromise is intercept the login process and change the userid of the logged in user. After that, the app will function as the user with the userId that we have provided [and that] has logged in, providing full control over all of their locks,” they wrote. Physical Threat Adding insult to injury, researchers also said the physical locks can easily be picked with a “thin pick”. “The device allows for a thin pick to be inserted in to the body and used to shim the internal mechanism to open the lock manually,” the researchers said. The physical lock mechanism is meant as a failsafe should the electronic locking mechanism fail. “An amateur can reliably open them quickly and easily, both with single pin picking and raking. It’s certainly not up to the standards we would expect to see on an external door,” researchers cautioned. U-tec was notified of the vulnerabilities in April, 2019 and quickly replied asking for clarification. On May 1, U-tec fixed the API flaw and on May 28 requested another month to fix the BLE issue before disclosure. Last week, Pen Test Partners asked for an update and did not hear back from U-tec.

"Keyloggers: Implementing keyloggers in Windows. Part TwoIn February 2005, Joe Lopez, a businessman from Florida, filed a suit against Bank of America after unknown hackers stole $90,000 from his Bank of America account. The money had been transferred to Latvia.An investigation showed that Mr. Lopez’s computer was infected with a malicious program, Backdoor.Coreflood, which records every keystroke and sends this information to malicious users via the Internet. This is how the hackers got hold of Joe Lopez’s user name and password, since Mr. Lopez often used the Internet to manage his Bank of America account.However the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff, saying that Mr. Lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his bank account on the Internet: a signature for the malicious code that was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product databases back in 2003.Joe Lopez’s losses were caused by a combination of overall carelessness and an ordinary keylogging program.The term ‘keylogger’ itself is neutral, and the word describes the program’s function. Most sources define a keylogger as a software program designed to secretly monitor and log all keystrokes. This definition is not altogether correct, since a keylogger doesn’t have to be software – it can also be a device. Keylogging devices are much rarer than keylogging software, but it is important to keep their existence in mind when thinking about information security.Most modern keyloggers are considered to be legitimate software or hardware and are sold on the open market. Developers and vendors offer a long list of cases in which it would be legal and appropriate to use keyloggers, including:However, the justifications listed above are more subjective than objective; the situations can all be resolved using other methods. Additionally, any legitimate keylogging program can still be used with malicious or criminal intent. Today, keyloggers are mainly used to steal user data relating to various online payment systems, and virus writers are constantly writing new keylogger Trojans for this very purpose.Furthermore, many keyloggers hide themselves in the system (i.e. they have rootkit functionality), which makes them fully-fledged Trojan programs.As such programs are extensively used by cyber criminals, detecting them is a priority for antivirus companies. Kaspersky Lab’s malware classification system has a dedicated category for malicious programs with keylogging functionality: Trojan-Spy. Trojan-Spy programs, as the name suggests, track user activity, save the information to the user’s hard disk and then forward it to the author or ‘master’ of the Trojan. The information collected includes keystrokes and screen-shots, used in the theft of banking data to support online fraud.Unlike other types of malicious program, keyloggers present no threat to the system itself. Nevertheless, they can pose a serious threat to users, as they can be used to intercept passwords and other confidential information entered via the keyboard. As a result, cyber criminals can get PIN codes and account numbers for e-payment systems, passwords to online gaming accounts, email addresses, user names, email passwords etc.Once a cyber criminal has got hold of confidential user data, s/he can easily transfer money from the user’s account or access the user’s online gaming account. Unfortunately access to confidential data can sometimes have consequences which are far more serious than an individual’s loss of a few dollars. Keyloggers can be used as tools in both industrial and political espionage, accessing data which may include proprietary commercial information and classified government material which could compromise the security of commercial and state-owned organizations (for example, by stealing private encryption keys).Keyloggers, phishing and social engineering (see ‘Computers, Networks and Theft’) are currently the main methods being used in cyber fraud. Users who are aware of security issues can easily protect themselves against phishing by ignoring phishing emails and by not entering any personal information on suspicious websites. It is more difficult, however, for users to combat keyloggers; the only possible method is to use an appropriate security solution, as it’s usually impossible for a user to tell that a keylogger has been installed on his/ her machine.According to Cristine Hoepers, the manager of Brazil’s Computer Emergency Response Team, which works under the aegis of the country’s Internet Steering Committee, keyloggers have pushed phishing out of first place as the most-used method in the theft of confidential information. What’s more, keyloggers are becoming more sophisticated – they track websites visited by the user and only log keystrokes entered on websites of particular interest to the cyber criminal.In recent years, we have seen a considerable increase in the number of different kinds of malicious programs which have keylogging functionality. No Internet user is immune to cyber criminals, no matter where in the world s/he is located and no matter what organization s/he works for.One of the most publicized keylogging incidents recently was the theft of over $1million from client accounts at the major Scandinavian bank Nordea. In August 2006 Nordea clients started to receive emails, allegedly from the bank, suggesting that they install an antispam product, which was supposedly attached to the message. When a user opened the file and downloaded it to his/ her computer, the machine would be infected with a well known Trojan called Haxdoor. This would be activated when the victim registered at Nordea’s online service, and the Trojan would display an error notification with a request to re-enter the registration information. The keylogger incorporated in the Trojan would record data entered by the bank’s clients, and later send this data to the cyber criminals’ server. This was how cyber criminals were able to access client accounts, and transfer money from them. According to Haxdoor’s author, the Trojan has also been used in attacks against Australian banks and many others.On January 24, 2004 the notorious Mydoom worm caused a major epidemic. MyDoom broke the record previously set by Sobig, provoking the largest epidemic in Internet history to date. The worm used social engineering methods and organized a DoS attack on www.sco.com; the site was either unreachable or unstable for several months as a consequence. The worm left a Trojan on infected computers which was subsequently used to infect the victim machines with new modifications of the worm. The fact that MyDoom had a keylogging function to harvest credit card numbers was not widely publicized in the media.In early 2005 the London police prevented a serious attempt to steal banking data. After attacking a banking system, the cyber criminals had planned to steal $423 million from Sumitomo Mitsui’s London-based offices. The main component of the Trojan used, which was created by the 32-year-old Yeron Bolondi, was a keylogger that allowed the criminals to track all the keystrokes entered when victims used the bank’s client interface.In May 2005 a married couple was arrested in London who were charged with developing malicious programs that were used by some Israeli companies in industrial espionage. The scale of the espionage was shocking: the companies named by the Israeli authorities in investigative reports included cellular providers like Cellcom and Pelephone, and satellite television provider YES. According to reports, the Trojan was used to access information relating to the PR agency Rani Rahav, whose clients included Partner Communications (Israel’s second leading cellular services provider) and the HOT cable television group. The Mayer company, which imports Volvo and Honda cars to Israel, was suspected of committing industrial espionage against Champion Motors, which imports Audi and Volkswagen cars to the country. Ruth Brier-Haephrati, who sold the keylogging Trojan that her husband Michael Haephrati created, was sentenced to four years in jail, and Michael received a two-year sentence.In February 2006, the Brazilian police arrested 55 people involved in spreading malicious programs which were used to steal user information and passwords to banking systems. The keyloggers were activated when the users visited their banks’ websites, and secretly tracked and subsequently sent all data entered on these pages to cyber criminals. The total amount of money stolen from 200 client accounts at six of the country’s banks totaled $4.7million.At approximately the same time, a similar criminal grouping made up of young (20 – 30 year old) Russians and Ukrainians was arrested. In late 2004, the group began sending banking clients in France and a number of other countries email messages that contained a malicious program – namely, a keylogger. Furthermore, these spy programs were placed on specially created websites; users were lured to these sites using classic social engineering methods. In the same way as in the cases described above, the program was activated when users visited their banks’ websites, and the keylogger harvested all the information entered by the user and sent it to the cyber criminals. In the course of eleven months over one million dollars was stolen.There are many more examples of cyber criminals using keyloggers – most financial cybercrime is committed using keyloggers, since these programs are the most comprehensive and reliable tool for tracking electronic information.The fact that cyber criminals choose to use keyloggers time and again is confirmed by IT security companies.One of VeriSign’s recent reports notes that in recent years, the company has seen a rapid growth in the number of malicious programs that have keylogging functionality.One report issued by Symantec shows that almost 50% of malicious programs detected by the company’s analysts during the past year do not pose a direct threat to computers, but instead are used by cyber criminals to harvest personal user data.According to research conducted by John Bambenek, an analyst at the SANS Institute, approximately 10 million computers in the US alone are currently infected with a malicious program which has a keylogging function. Using these figures, together with the total number of American users of e-payment systems, possible losses are estimated to be $24.3 million.Kaspersky Lab is constantly detecting new malicious programs which have a keylogging function. One of the first virus alerts on securelist.com, Kaspersky Lab’s dedicated malware information site, was published on 15th June 2001. The warning related to TROJ_LATINUS.SVR, a Trojan with a keylogging function. Since then, there has been a steady stream of new keyloggers and new modifications. Kaspersky antivirus database currently contain records for more than 300 families of keyloggers. This number does not include keyloggers that are part of complex threats (i.e. in which the spy component provides additional functionality).Most modern malicious programs are hybrids which implement many different technologies. Due to this, any category of malicious program may include programs with keylogger (sub)functionality. The number of spy programs detected by Kaspersky Lab each month is on the increase, and most of these programs use keylogging technology.The main idea behind keyloggers is to get in between any two links in the chain of events between when a key is pressed and when information about that keystroke is displayed on the monitor. This can be achieved using video surveillance, a hardware bug in the keyboard, wiring or the computer itself, intercepting input/ output, substituting the keyboard driver, the filter driver in the keyboard stack, intercepting kernel functions by any means possible (substituting addresses in system tables, splicing function code, etc.), intercepting DLL functions in user mode, and, finally, requesting information from the keyboard using standard documented methods.Experience shows that the more complex the approach, the less likely it is to be used in common Trojan programs and the more likely it is to be used in specially designed Trojan programs which are designed to steal financial data from a specific company.Keyloggers can be divided into two categories: keylogging devices and keylogging software. Keyloggers which fall into the first category are usually small devices that can be fixed to the keyboard, or placed within a cable or the computer itself. The keylogging software category is made up of dedicated programs designed to track and log keystrokes.The most common methods used to construct keylogging software are as follows:We will provide a detailed explanation of the different ways keyloggers are constructed in the second half of this article (to be published in the near future). But first, here are some statistics.A rough breakdown of the different types of keyloggers is shown in the pie chart below:Recently, keyloggers that disguise their files to keep them from being found manually or by an antivirus program have become more numerous. These stealth techniques are called rootkit technologies. There are two main rootkit technologies used by keyloggers:A rough breakdown of the techniques used by keyloggers to mask their activity is shown in the pie chart below:Keyloggers spread in much the same way that other malicious programs spread. Excluding cases where keyloggers are purchased and installed by a jealous spouse or partner, and the use of keyloggers by security services, keyloggers are mostly spread using the following methods):Most antivirus companies have already added known keyloggers to their databases, making protecting against keyloggers no different from protecting against other types of malicious program: install an antivirus product and keep its database up to date. However, since most antivirus products classify keyloggers as potentially malicious, or potentially undesirable programs, users should ensure that their antivirus product will, with default settings, detect this type of malware. If not, then the product should be configured accordingly, to ensure protection against most common keyloggers.Let’s take a closer look at the methods that can be used to protect against unknown keyloggers or a keylogger designed to target a specific system.Since the chief purpose of keyloggers is to get confidential data (bank card numbers, passwords, etc.), the most logical ways to protect against unknown keyloggers are as follows:Using a one-time password can help minimize losses if the password you enter is intercepted, as the password generated can be used one time only, and the period of time during which the password can be used is limited. Even if a one-time password is intercepted, a cyber criminal will not be able to use it in order to obtain access to confidential information.In order to get one-time passwords, you can use a special device such as:In order to generate one-time passwords, you can also use mobile phone text messaging systems that are registered with the banking system and receive a PIN-code as a reply. The PIN is then used together with the personal code for authentication.If either of the above devices is used to generate passwords, the procedure is as described below:When using a calculator device to generate a password, the user will enter his PIN code on the device ‘keyboard’ and press the “>” button.One-time password generators are widely used by banking systems in Europe, Asia, the US and Australia. For example, Lloyds TSB, a leading bank, decided to use password generators back in November 2005.In this case, however, the company has to spend a considerable amount of money as it had to acquire and distribute password generators to its clients, and develop/ purchase the accompanying software.A more cost efficient solution is proactive protection on the client side, which can warn a user if an attempt is made to install or activate keylogging software.Proactive protection against keyloggers in Kaspersky Internet SecurityThe main drawback of this method is that the user is actively involved and has to decide what action should be taken. If a user is not very technically experienced, s/he might make the wrong decision, resulting in a keylogger being allowed to bypass the antivirus solution. However, if developers minimize user involvement, then keyloggers will be able to evade detection due to an insufficiently rigorous security policy. However, if settings are too stringent, then other, useful programs which contain legitimate keylogging functions might also be blocked.The final method which can be used to protect against both keylogging software and hardware is using a virtual keyboard. A virtual keyboard is a program that shows a keyboard on the screen, and the keys can be ‘pressed’ by using a mouse.The idea of an on-screen keyboard is nothing new – the Windows operating system has a built-in on-screen keyboard that can be launched as follows: Start > Programs > Accessories > Accessibility > On-Screen Keyboard.However, on-screen keyboards aren’t a very popular method of outsmarting keyloggers. They were not designed to protect against cyber threats, but as an accessibility tool for disabled users. Information entered using an on-screen keyboard can easily be intercepted by a malicious program. In order to be used to protect against keyloggers, on-screen keyboards have to be specially designed in order to ensure that information entered or transmitted via the on-screen keyboard cannot be intercepted.This article has provided an overview of how keyloggers – both keylogging software and hardware – function and are used.Keyloggers: Implementing keyloggers in Windows.

Part TwoIn February 2005, Joe Lopez, a businessman from Florida, filed a suit against Bank of America after unknown hackers stole $90,000 from his Bank of America account. The money had been transferred to Latvia.An investigation showed that Mr. Lopez’s computer was infected with a malicious program, Backdoor.Coreflood, which records every keystroke and sends this information to malicious users via the Internet. This is how the hackers got hold of Joe Lopez’s user name and password, since Mr. Lopez often used the Internet to manage his Bank of America account.However the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff, saying that Mr. Lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his bank account on the Internet: a signature for the malicious code that was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product databases back in 2003.Joe Lopez’s losses were caused by a combination of overall carelessness and an ordinary keylogging program.The term ‘keylogger’ itself is neutral, and the word describes the program’s function. Most sources define a keylogger as a software program designed to secretly monitor and log all keystrokes. This definition is not altogether correct, since a keylogger doesn’t have to be software – it can also be a device. Keylogging devices are much rarer than keylogging software, but it is important to keep their existence in mind when thinking about information security.Most modern keyloggers are considered to be legitimate software or hardware and are sold on the open market. Developers and vendors offer a long list of cases in which it would be legal and appropriate to use keyloggers, including:However, the justifications listed above are more subjective than objective; the situations can all be resolved using other methods. Additionally, any legitimate keylogging program can still be used with malicious or criminal intent. Today, keyloggers are mainly used to steal user data relating to various online payment systems, and virus writers are constantly writing new keylogger Trojans for this very purpose.Furthermore, many keyloggers hide themselves in the system (i.e. they have rootkit functionality), which makes them fully-fledged Trojan programs.As such programs are extensively used by cyber criminals, detecting them is a priority for antivirus companies. Kaspersky Lab’s malware classification system has a dedicated category for malicious programs with keylogging functionality: Trojan-Spy. Trojan-Spy programs, as the name suggests, track user activity, save the information to the user’s hard disk and then forward it to the author or ‘master’ of the Trojan. The information collected includes keystrokes and screen-shots, used in the theft of banking data to support online fraud.Unlike other types of malicious program, keyloggers present no threat to the system itself. Nevertheless, they can pose a serious threat to users, as they can be used to intercept passwords and other confidential information entered via the keyboard. As a result, cyber criminals can get PIN codes and account numbers for e-payment systems, passwords to online gaming accounts, email addresses, user names, email passwords etc.Once a cyber criminal has got hold of confidential user data, s/he can easily transfer money from the user’s account or access the user’s online gaming account. Unfortunately access to confidential data can sometimes have consequences which are far more serious than an individual’s loss of a few dollars. Keyloggers can be used as tools in both industrial and political espionage, accessing data which may include proprietary commercial information and classified government material which could compromise the security of commercial and state-owned organizations (for example, by stealing private encryption keys).Keyloggers, phishing and social engineering (see ‘Computers, Networks and Theft’) are currently the main methods being used in cyber fraud. Users who are aware of security issues can easily protect themselves against phishing by ignoring phishing emails and by not entering any personal information on suspicious websites. It is more difficult, however, for users to combat keyloggers; the only possible method is to use an appropriate security solution, as it’s usually impossible for a user to tell that a keylogger has been installed on his/ her machine.According to Cristine Hoepers, the manager of Brazil’s Computer Emergency Response Team, which works under the aegis of the country’s Internet Steering Committee, keyloggers have pushed phishing out of first place as the most-used method in the theft of confidential information. What’s more, keyloggers are becoming more sophisticated – they track websites visited by the user and only log keystrokes entered on websites of particular interest to the cyber criminal.In recent years, we have seen a considerable increase in the number of different kinds of malicious programs which have keylogging functionality. No Internet user is immune to cyber criminals, no matter where in the world s/he is located and no matter what organization s/he works for.One of the most publicized keylogging incidents recently was the theft of over $1million from client accounts at the major Scandinavian bank Nordea. In August 2006 Nordea clients started to receive emails, allegedly from the bank, suggesting that they install an antispam product, which was supposedly attached to the message. When a user opened the file and downloaded it to his/ her computer, the machine would be infected with a well known Trojan called Haxdoor. This would be activated when the victim registered at Nordea’s online service, and the Trojan would display an error notification with a request to re-enter the registration information. The keylogger incorporated in the Trojan would record data entered by the bank’s clients, and later send this data to the cyber criminals’ server. This was how cyber criminals were able to access client accounts, and transfer money from them. According to Haxdoor’s author, the Trojan has also been used in attacks against Australian banks and many others.On January 24, 2004 the notorious Mydoom worm caused a major epidemic. MyDoom broke the record previously set by Sobig, provoking the largest epidemic in Internet history to date. The worm used social engineering methods and organized a DoS attack on www.sco.com; the site was either unreachable or unstable for several months as a consequence. The worm left a Trojan on infected computers which was subsequently used to infect the victim machines with new modifications of the worm. The fact that MyDoom had a keylogging function to harvest credit card numbers was not widely publicized in the media.In early 2005 the London police prevented a serious attempt to steal banking data. After attacking a banking system, the cyber criminals had planned to steal $423 million from Sumitomo Mitsui’s London-based offices. The main component of the Trojan used, which was created by the 32-year-old Yeron Bolondi, was a keylogger that allowed the criminals to track all the keystrokes entered when victims used the bank’s client interface.In May 2005 a married couple was arrested in London who were charged with developing malicious programs that were used by some Israeli companies in industrial espionage. The scale of the espionage was shocking: the companies named by the Israeli authorities in investigative reports included cellular providers like Cellcom and Pelephone, and satellite television provider YES. According to reports, the Trojan was used to access information relating to the PR agency Rani Rahav, whose clients included Partner Communications (Israel’s second leading cellular services provider) and the HOT cable television group. The Mayer company, which imports Volvo and Honda cars to Israel, was suspected of committing industrial espionage against Champion Motors, which imports Audi and Volkswagen cars to the country. Ruth Brier-Haephrati, who sold the keylogging Trojan that her husband Michael Haephrati created, was sentenced to four years in jail, and Michael received a two-year sentence.In February 2006, the Brazilian police arrested 55 people involved in spreading malicious programs which were used to steal user information and passwords to banking systems. The keyloggers were activated when the users visited their banks’ websites, and secretly tracked and subsequently sent all data entered on these pages to cyber criminals. The total amount of money stolen from 200 client accounts at six of the country’s banks totaled $4.7million.At approximately the same time, a similar criminal grouping made up of young (20 – 30 year old) Russians and Ukrainians was arrested. In late 2004, the group began sending banking clients in France and a number of other countries email messages that contained a malicious program – namely, a keylogger. Furthermore, these spy programs were placed on specially created websites; users were lured to these sites using classic social engineering methods. In the same way as in the cases described above, the program was activated when users visited their banks’ websites, and the keylogger harvested all the information entered by the user and sent it to the cyber criminals. In the course of eleven months over one million dollars was stolen.There are many more examples of cyber criminals using keyloggers – most financial cybercrime is committed using keyloggers, since these programs are the most comprehensive and reliable tool for tracking electronic information.The fact that cyber criminals choose to use keyloggers time and again is confirmed by IT security companies.One of VeriSign’s recent reports notes that in recent years, the company has seen a rapid growth in the number of malicious programs that have keylogging functionality.One report issued by Symantec shows that almost 50% of malicious programs detected by the company’s analysts during the past year do not pose a direct threat to computers, but instead are used by cyber criminals to harvest personal user data.According to research conducted by John Bambenek, an analyst at the SANS Institute, approximately 10 million computers in the US alone are currently infected with a malicious program which has a keylogging function. Using these figures, together with the total number of American users of e-payment systems, possible losses are estimated to be $24.3 million.Kaspersky Lab is constantly detecting new malicious programs which have a keylogging function. One of the first virus alerts on securelist.com, Kaspersky Lab’s dedicated malware information site, was published on 15th June 2001. The warning related to TROJ_LATINUS.SVR, a Trojan with a keylogging function. Since then, there has been a steady stream of new keyloggers and new modifications. Kaspersky antivirus database currently contain records for more than 300 families of keyloggers. This number does not include keyloggers that are part of complex threats (i.e. in which the spy component provides additional functionality).Most modern malicious programs are hybrids which implement many different technologies. Due to this, any category of malicious program may include programs with keylogger (sub)functionality. The number of spy programs detected by Kaspersky Lab each month is on the increase, and most of these programs use keylogging technology.The main idea behind keyloggers is to get in between any two links in the chain of events between when a key is pressed and when information about that keystroke is displayed on the monitor. This can be achieved using video surveillance, a hardware bug in the keyboard, wiring or the computer itself, intercepting input/ output, substituting the keyboard driver, the filter driver in the keyboard stack, intercepting kernel functions by any means possible (substituting addresses in system tables, splicing function code, etc.), intercepting DLL functions in user mode, and, finally, requesting information from the keyboard using standard documented methods.Experience shows that the more complex the approach, the less likely it is to be used in common Trojan programs and the more likely it is to be used in specially designed Trojan programs which are designed to steal financial data from a specific company.Keyloggers can be divided into two categories: keylogging devices and keylogging software. Keyloggers which fall into the first category are usually small devices that can be fixed to the keyboard, or placed within a cable or the computer itself. The keylogging software category is made up of dedicated programs designed to track and log keystrokes.The most common methods used to construct keylogging software are as follows:We will provide a detailed explanation of the different ways keyloggers are constructed in the second half of this article (to be published in the near future). But first, here are some statistics.A rough breakdown of the different types of keyloggers is shown in the pie chart below:Recently, keyloggers that disguise their files to keep them from being found manually or by an antivirus program have become more numerous. These stealth techniques are called rootkit technologies. There are two main rootkit technologies used by keyloggers:A rough breakdown of the techniques used by keyloggers to mask their activity is shown in the pie chart below:Keyloggers spread in much the same way that other malicious programs spread. Excluding cases where keyloggers are purchased and installed by a jealous spouse or partner, and the use of keyloggers by security services, keyloggers are mostly spread using the following methods):Most antivirus companies have already added known keyloggers to their databases, making protecting against keyloggers no different from protecting against other types of malicious program: install an antivirus product and keep its database up to date.

"The two malware families have sophisticated capabilities to exfiltrate SMS messages, WhatsApp messaging content and geolocation. Researchers have uncovered two novel Android surveillanceware families being used by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group to target military, nuclear and election entities in Pakistan and Kashmir. The two malware families, which researchers call “Hornbill” and “SunBird,” have sophisticated capabilities to exfiltrate SMS messages, encrypted messaging app content and geolocation, as well as other types of sensitive information. Researchers first saw Hornbill as early as May 2018, with newer samples of the malware emerging on December 2020. They said the first Sunbird sample dates back to 2017 and was last seen active on December 2019. “Hornbill and SunBird have both similarities and differences in the way they operate on an infected device,” said Apurva Kumar, staff security intelligence engineer, and Kristin Del Rosso, senior security intelligence researcher, with Lookout, on Thursday. “While SunBird features remote access trojan (RAT) functionality – a malware that can execute commands on an infected device as directed by an attacker – Hornbill is a discreet surveillance tool used to extract a selected set of data of interest to its operator.” Malware Attack Targeting Military, Nuclear, Election Entities The malware strains were seen in attacks targeting personnel linked to Pakistan’s military and various nuclear authorities, and Indian election officials in Kashmir. Kashmiris are a Dardic ethnic group native to the disputed Kashmir Valley (and a previous target for other Android malware threat actors). “While the exact number of victims is not known across all campaigns for SunBird and Hornbill, at least 156 victims were identified in a single campaign for Sunbird in 2019 and included phone numbers from India, Pakistan, and Kazakhstan,” Kumar told Threatpost. “According to the publicly exposed exfiltrated data we were able to find, individuals in at least 14 different countries were targeted.” For instance, attackers targeted an individual who applied for a position at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, individuals with numerous contacts in the Pakistan Air Force, as well as officers responsible for electoral rolls located in the Pulwama district of Kashmir. Sunbird samples hosted on third-party app stores. Credit: Lookout In regards to the initial attack vectors for the malware samples, researchers pointed to samples of SunBird found hosted on third-party app stores, providing a clue for one possible distribution mechanism. However, researchers have not yet found SunBird on the official Google Play marketplace. SunBird has been disguised as applications such as security services (including a fictional “Google Security Framework”), apps tied to specific locations (like “Kashmir News”) or activities (“including “Falconry Connect” or “Mania Soccer”). Researchers said the majority of these applications appear to target Muslim individuals. Meanwhile, Hornbill applications impersonate various chat (such as Fruit Chat, Cucu Chat and Kako Chat) and system applications. “Considering many of these malware samples are trojanized – as in they contain complete user functionality – social engineering may also play a part in convincing targets to install the malware,” said Kumar and Del Rosso. “No use of exploits was observed directly by Lookout researchers.” Malware Cybersecurity Surveillance Capabilities Both malware families have a wide range of data exfiltration capabilities. They are able to collect call logs, contacts, device metadata (such as phone numbers, models, manufacturers and Android operating system version), geolocation, images stored on external storage and WhatsApp voice notes. Credit: Lookout In addition, both families can request device administrator privileges, take screenshots of whatever victims are currently viewing on their devices, take photos with the device camera, record environment and call audio and scrape WhatsApp message and contacts and WhatsApp notifications (via the Android accessibility service feature). SunBird has a more extensive set of malicious functionalities than Hornbill, with the ability to upload all data at regular intervals to its C2 servers. For instance, SunBird can also collect a list of installed applications on the victims’ devices, browser history, calendar information, WhatsApp Audio files, documents, databases and images and more. And, it can run arbitrary commands as root or download attacker-specified content from FTP shares. “In contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird,” said Kumar and Del Rosso. “Not only does it target a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data when it initially runs and not at regular intervals like SunBird. After that, it only uploads changes in data to keep mobile data and battery usage low.” Researchers named Hornbill after the Indian Grey Hornbill, which is the state bird of Chandigarh in India, where they believe the developers of Hornbill are located. SunBird’s name, meanwhile, stemmed from the malicious services within the malware called “SunService” – and the sunbird is also native to India, they said. State-Sponsored APT Behind The Cyberattack The malware families have been linked “with high confidence” to the APT Confucius. This APT has been on the cybercrime scene since 2013 as a state-sponsored, pro-India actor. The APT has previously targeted victims in Pakistan and South Asia. “We are confident SunBird and Hornbill are two tools used by the same actor, perhaps for different surveillance purposes,” said Kumar and Del Rosso.

"Mozilla has patched a second actively-exploited vulnerability in Firefox this week. UPDATE Mozilla has fixed a high-severity vulnerability in its Firefox browser being actively exploited in the wild. The vulnerability (CVE-2019-11708) is separate from a critical flaw under active attack that was patched earlier this week (CVE-2019-11707). However, both vulnerabilities were discovered by Coinbase Security, who said that the flaws were being used in active spear phishing attacks targeting Coinbase employees. The high-severity sandbox-escape flaw stems from insufficient vetting of “Prompt:Open” inter process communication (IPC) messages, which are passed between different processes on the browser. The flaw “can result in the non-sandboxed parent process opening web content chosen by a compromised child process,” according to Mozilla’s advisory. “When combined with additional vulnerabilities this could result in executing arbitrary code on the user’s computer,” according to Mozilla. Mozilla said that Firefox 67.0.4 and Firefox ESR 60.7.2 fix the issue. Coinbase chief information security officer Philip Martin said on Twitter, Wednesday, that Coinbase had spotted both this high-severity flaw, as well as the critical flaw patched earlier this week, being exploited by an attacker who was targeting Coinbase employees. Martin said he has seen no evidence of attacks targeting Coinbase customers – and that Coinbase was not the only cryptocurrency organization targeted in the campaign. “We walked back the entire attack, recovered and reported the 0-day to firefox, pulled apart the malware and infra used in the attack and are working with various orgs to continue burning down attacker infrastructure and digging into the attacker involved,” he said on Twitter. Martin said that a more detailed analysis will be released next week. The critical flaw patched earlier this week (CVE-2019-11707) is a type confusion vulnerability in the Array.pop, which is an array method that is used in JavaScript objects in Firefox. The vulnerability, under active attack, enables bad actors to take full control of systems running the vulnerable Firefox versions. Tor Browser also updated to version 8.5.2 in response to the critical Firefox flaw (The issue affects Tor, since, as its founders said back in 2016, Firefox is at the heart of the privacy-focused onion browser). “On Monday, June 17, 2019, Coinbase reported a vulnerability used as part of targeted attacks for a spear phishing campaign,” Selena Deckelmann, senior director of Firefox Browser Engineering, told Threatpost. “In less than 24 hours, we released a fix for the exploit.” This article was updated on June 26 at 8am to reflect the correct CVE for the vulnerability, CVE-2019-11708 (not CVE-2019-11709). : Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion","<s>[INST] Mozilla has patched a second actively-exploited vulnerability in Firefox this week.

Martin said he has seen no evidence of attacks targeting Coinbase customers – and that Coinbase was not the only cryptocurrency organization targeted in the campaign. “We walked back the entire attack, recovered and reported the 0-day to firefox, pulled apart the malware and infra used in the attack and are working with various orgs to continue burning down attacker infrastructure and digging into the attacker involved,” he said on Twitter. Martin said that a more detailed analysis will be released next week. The critical flaw patched earlier this week (CVE-2019-11707) is a type confusion vulnerability in the Array.pop, which is an array method that is used in JavaScript objects in Firefox. The vulnerability, under active attack, enables bad actors to take full control of systems running the vulnerable Firefox versions. Tor Browser also updated to version 8.5.2 in response to the critical Firefox flaw (The issue affects Tor, since, as its founders said back in 2016, Firefox is at the heart of the privacy-focused onion browser). “On Monday, June 17, 2019, Coinbase reported a vulnerability used as part of targeted attacks for a spear phishing campaign,” Selena Deckelmann, senior director of Firefox Browser Engineering, told Threatpost. “In less than 24 hours, we released a fix for the exploit.” This article was updated on June 26 at 8am to reflect the correct CVE for the vulnerability, CVE-2019-11708 (not CVE-2019-11709). : Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion </s>"
"A series of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities – including clear text passwords – exist in a set of Honeywell SCADA systems. A series of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist in a popular web-based SCADA system made by Honeywell that make it easy to expose passwords and in turn, give attackers a foothold into the vulnerable network. The flaws exist in some versions of Honeywell’s XL Web II controllers, systems deployed across the critical infrastructure sector, including wastewater, energy, and manufacturing companies. An advisory from the Department of Homeland Security’s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) warned about the vulnerabilities Thursday. According to ICS-CERT, specifically Honeywell’s XL1000C500 XLWebExe-2-01-00 and prior, and XLWeb 500 XLWebExe-1-02-08 and prior are vulnerable. The company has developed a fix, version 3.04.05.05, to address the issues but users have to call their local Honeywell Building Solutions branch to receive the update, according to the company. The controllers suffer from five vulnerabilities in total but the scariest one might be the fact that passwords for the controllers are stored in clear text. Furthermore, if attackers wanted to, they could disclose that password simply by accessing a particular URL. An attacker could also carry out a path traversal attack by accessing a specific URL, open and change some parameters by accessing a particular URL, or establish a new user session. The problem with starting a new user session is that the controllers didn’t invalidate any existing session identifier, something that could have made it easier for an attacker to steal any active authenticated sessions. Maxim Rupp, an independent security researcher based in Germany, dug up the bugs and teased them on Twitter at the beginning of January. He described them in depth in a blog post earlier this week. Rupp has identified bugs in Honeywell equipment before. Two years ago he discovered a pair of vulnerabilities in Tuxedo Touch, a home automation controller made by the company, that could have let an attacker unlock a house’s doors or modify its climate controls. It’s unclear how widespread the usage of Honeywell’s XL Web II controllers is. While Honeywell is a US-based company, according to ICS-CERT’s advisory the majority of the affected products are used in Europe and the Middle East. When reached on Friday, a spokesperson for Honeywell confirmed that the affected controllers are used in Europe and the Middle East. The company also stressed that the vulnerabilities were patched in September 2016 after they were reported in August.

"Cisco said that CVE-2019-1663, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. Cisco is urging customers to update their wireless VPN and firewall routers, after patching a critical vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability, CVE-2019-1663, has a CVSS score of 9.8 and impacts the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router. These small business routers are used for wireless connectivity in small offices and home offices. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user,” said Cisco is its Wednesday advisory. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface for the three router models. The management interface for these devices is available through a local LAN connection or the remote management feature. The glitch stems from the interface, which does not properly double check the user-supplied data sent to it. So an attacker could send malicious HTTP requests to the impacted targeted devices, and ultimately execute code on them. Making matters worse, the attacker could be unauthenticated and remote. “The vulnerability is reportedly due to improperly validated user input fields through the HTTP/HTTPS user management interface, said Ryan Seguin, engineer with Tenable, in a Wednesday analysis of the flaw. “Cisco has tagged this vulnerability with CWE-119, the designation for a buffer overflow. This means that a pre-authentication user input field on these devices can be manipulated into dropping code into the device’s memory, which it then executes at the system level.” Routers with the remote-management feature enabled are exposed to a remote attack, Cisco said. The feature is disabled by default, but administrators can check if remote management is enabled by selecting Basic Settings>Remote Management in their router’s web interface. While Cisco did not detail whether the vulnerability was being exploited in the wild, the tech giant released firmware updates for the affected devices that address it. The patched software versions are: RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall version 1.2.2.1, RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router version 1.0.3.45, and RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router version 1.3.1.1. The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers Yu Zhang and Haoliang Lu, and T. Shiomitsu of Pen Test Partners. Cisco routers with vulnerabilities – even those with patches issued for them – are frequently targeted by attackers. In January, malicious scanning activity targeting Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN routers with just-patched vulnerabilities was discovered. And in November, attackers actively exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-15454) in certain Cisco security products, to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. : IoT Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059: Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021: Remote Services,T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562: Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Cisco said that CVE-2019-1663, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Clothing store Eddie Bauer has become the latest retail chain to acknowledge that malware has led to a breach of its point of sale systems. In a press release (.PDF) late last week Eddie Bauer confirmed that any customers who used a payment card at a store over the past seven months, from January 2 to July 17, may be affected. When it comes to exactly how many stores were affected by the malware, the notice is vague, but the way it’s worded makes it sound as if point of sale systems at all 370 stores it operates, in the US and Canada, were hit by the malware. The notice states that cardholder names, payment card numbers, security codes and expiration dates may have been extracted by the malware. The notification doesn’t go into details around what type of malware it was or how Eddie Bauer detected the breach. The company claims its taken steps to strengthen the security of its point of sale systems in wake of the attack but doesn’t specify exactly how its done so. As is customary in situations like these, Eddie Bauer confirmed that it launched an investigation after it became aware of the issue and that the company is continuing to work alongside the FBI and “cyber security experts.” “We have fully identified and contained the incident and that no customers will be responsible for any fraudulent charges to their accounts. In addition, we’ve taken steps to strengthen the security of our point of sale systems to prevent this from happening in the future,” Mike Edeck, Chief Executive Officer of Eddie Bauer said, Thursday. The outdoor clothing company is stressing that its e-commerce platform was not affected by the breach and that any payment card information used for online purchases at eddiebauer.com should be safe. In one part of the press release, the Bellevue, Wash.-based company calls the intrusion “part of a sophisticated attack directed at multiple restaurants, hotels, and retailers” but it’s unclear if the retailer is hinting at a specific malware campaign that unites the sectors, or if its speaking in broader terms about the influx of POS malware hitting companies as of late.

"Microsoft won’t be patching the bug, but a proof of concept shows the potential for successful malware implantation. A previously unknown bug in Microsoft Windows would allow an attacker to spoof Windows dialog boxes that surface when making changes to the Windows registry. This would allow an adversary to plant malware or make other nefarious changes in the registry while getting around Windows’ built-in defenses, according to a researcher. Normally when there is a change to the registry using a .reg file, a registry security warning dialog box will open, with an “are you sure you want to continue?” message and the option to click either “Yes” or “No.” According to white-hat researcher John Page (a.k.a. hyp3rlinx), it’s possible to edit what the dialog box says, to trick users into clicking “Yes.” For instance, an edited security prompt can tell them to click “Yes” to abort if they do not trust the source of the file. In reality, “Yes” clears the process to continue. “This can potentially trick unsavvy users into choosing the wrong selection shown on the dialog box,” Page explained in a write up Monday on the issue, adding that he created a proof-of-concept (POC) showing how to use the attack to plant a persistent remote code-execution backdoor onto a target computer. For its part, Microsoft said that it would not be issuing a patch. “The issue submitted does not meet the severity bar for servicing via a security update,” Jeff Jones, senior director at Microsoft, told Threatpost in an email. “When a dangerous file type like .reg file can have its default security warnings and dialog behavior tampered with, this is to me a vulnerability and potential attack vector,” countered Page, speaking to Threatpost. A Word on Windows Registry The Windows registry is essentially a database repository that logs software and application configuration information, device drivers for hardware and other system information. It also logs any changes made to these. “During the usage of the software or the hardware, the changes made to these configurations are updated in the registry,” according to Comodo. “Also, the changes made to Control Panel settings, file associations, Windows components and so on, during the use of the computer, are updated in the registry.” It added, “The registry also serves as an index to the operation of the kernel, revealing run-time information of the system.” As such, the registry is a critical factor for stability, reliability and performance of a computer, which makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals. As security firm Red Canary explained in a primer, “Since it is so ingrained into the operating start system, it’s a prime target for attacks and getting around standard security controls.” Common attack vectors according to Red Canary include the use of registry keys to store and hide next-step code for malware after it has been dropped on a system. “Furthermore, the malware uses native Windows tools to perform its commands, so it is undetectable by signature-based security software such as antivirus,” the firm said. Adversaries can also use program run keys and the Windows startup folder in order to create persistence on a victim endpoint; and, if the registry keys for a service are modified, “the ImagePath or binPath key can be modified to instead point to a malicious binary or a newly created one.” Not only does this allow for the malware to launch at Windows startup, but it can then be run under a local system account with elevated privileges. Changes to the registry that would open the door to such attacks typically trigger a warning dialog box alerting the user that changes are being made – and they would need to click “yes” or “no” to allow the action to continue. The Attack Registration files used by the Windows registry can be created from scratch by a user in the registry’s text editor; the issue is that Page uncovered that specially crafted .reg filenames can be created and used to spoof the default registry dialog warning box, “potentially making a user think they are canceling the registry import, as the security warning dialog box is now lying to them.” As he told Threatpost. “I was able to spoof the Windows registry dialog box security warning messages displayed to the user by creating a .reg file, using certain encoded characters %n %1 %0 along with my message within the filename itself, e.g. ‘Microsoft-Security-Update-v1.2-Windows-10.r%e%g%r%nC%l%i%c%k%b%Y%e%s%b%b%b%1%0.reg. This enabled me to override the dialog warnings with my own instructions, basically telling the user to click ‘Yes’ instead of ‘No’ if they do not trust the file, making them think it will be cancelled when they click ‘Yes’.” Furthermore, Page found that on Windows 10, it’s possible to hide the fact that the attack was successful. “Normally when you import a .reg file, Windows will show another dialog giving you a ‘successful’ import message,” Page told Threatpost. “However, creating a (null) byte, in this case a ‘%1’ at the end of the injected message in the filename, prevents the dialog from appearing. Therefore, if the user clicks ‘Yes’ as instructed by our spoofed message in the first dialog box, it will do the registry import (but the user may think it aborted safely). The importance of suppressing that second dialog is the user will never be tipped off that anything happened as no secondary dialog box appeared which may have given more suspicions.” The combination of the spoofed dialog box and the suppression of the secondary “successful import” message makes this a viable attack vector for delivering malware to Windows 10 machines, he said. In the proof-of-concept (video here), Page shows what can be done with an exploit; he was able to use the attack to add a persistent remote code execution backdoor. The POC involves adding a registry entry to the “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\iexplore.exe” file. When a user clicks opens the file, it executes a “persistent rundll32 payload targeting IE that references a JScript XML-based file on our remote server,” Page explained – and meanwhile, the security alert dialog boxes are spoofed and suppressed, so the user is none the wiser. In the POC, that XML file will execute whenever Microsoft Internet Explorer is launched. “Just like malware that uses Run keys to achieve persistence in the registry by writing to it, we are doing the same thing here,” he said. Windows UAC Interaction When targeting users with administrative privileges, one potential hurdle for an adversary lies in the User Account Control (UAC) defense in Windows. “When opening a Windows .reg file, UAC will launch, asking the user if they want to allow the program to make changes to their computer,” Page told Threatpost. “This is like the first line of defense and requires the user to click through it, unless for some reason UAC has been turned off. So, Windows UAC helps to prevent unauthorized changes to the system.” It’s only once an administrative user has clicked “yes” to allow a program to make changes to the computer that the spoofable registry dialog box comes up. To be successful, an adversary would need to bypass this with a separate exploit or convince the user to click “yes” using a social-engineering tactic. For non-admin “standard users” however, HKCU registry settings can still be hijacked without this obstacle. “No UAC will launch when targeting a non-administrator user, so this will hijack a current users registry settings without UAC getting in the way, meaning the user will have not have to click thru UAC,” Page told Threatpost. “UAC is only a problem when targeting users running with administrator privileges.” In this scenario, the registry .reg file script HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Test] “POC”=”666” will write to the current user’s registry settings, with no UAC interaction required if targeting a standard non-privileged user. Because the attack can require user interaction, Microsoft told Threatpost that the main mitigation for this particular issue and other social-engineering techniques is for customers to practice safe computing habits online by not clicking on links, opening files or accepting file transfers from untrusted sources.   : Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Microsoft won’t be patching the bug, but a proof of concept shows the potential for successful malware implantation.

Because the attack can require user interaction, Microsoft told Threatpost that the main mitigation for this particular issue and other social-engineering techniques is for customers to practice safe computing habits online by not clicking on links, opening files or accepting file transfers from untrusted sources.   : Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"
"A low-privileged process on a vulnerable machine could allow data harvesting and DoS. The IBM’s next-gen data-management software suffers from a shared-memory vulnerability that researchers said could lead to other threats — as demonstrated by a new proof-of-concept exploit for the bug. The IBM Db2 is a family of hybrid data-management products containing artificial intelligence, which can be used to analyze and manage both structured and unstructured data within enterprises. According to researchers at Trustwave, the recently disclosed bug (CVE-2020-4414) arises because the platform’s developers forgot to put explicit memory protections around the shared memory used by the Db2 trace facility. If exploited, it could lead to denial-of-service (DoS) or information disclosure. The trace facility is a function that allows users to isolate certain data points by monitoring selected parameters. This gives users what is essentially a log of control flow information (functions and associated parameter values), which can be helpful in slicing, dicing and separating out data for analysis. As such, the data at risk from an exploit could be literally anything generated within a targeted organization. For a healthcare provider for instance, cybercriminals could make off with HIPAA-protected patient information; a financial company meanwhile could be at risk for a breach of credit-card data. On the DoS front, Karl Sigler, senior security research manager for SpiderLabs at Trustwave, told Threatpost that “databases are often deployed as critical system. An attacker with a foothold on the system could consistently bring down the database and interrupt whatever system that depends on it and it’s data.” The crux of the issue is that it allows local privilege-escalation and crashing of the device. The lack of explicit memory protections “allows any local users read-and-write access to that memory area,” Trustwave researchers said, in their PoC exploit writeup for the bug, issued on Thursday. “In turn, this allows them to access critically sensitive data as well as the ability to change how the trace subsystem functions, resulting in a denial-of-service condition in the database.” They added, “Needless to say, both shouldn’t be possible for regular users.” While technically an attacker would need to be local, it’s possible to remotely execute such a low-privileged process (i.e., malware) on a vulnerable machine to trigger an exploit: “Low-privileged processes, running on the same computer as Db2 database, can alter Db2 traces and capture sensitive data – and use that later for subsequent attacks,” the researchers explained. PoC Launched To exploit the bug, attackers can send a specially crafted request to the trace facility. Trustwave’s PoC starts with launching Process Explorer or other any similar tool in Windows to check open handles of the Db2 main process. Then, the researchers created a simple console application that tries to open a given memory section by name. Once that’s running, an attacker can enable Db2 tracing, which opens the door to an attack. “And now we can see what’s been written to those memory sections,” according to Trustwave’s analysis. “In the end, this means that an unprivileged local user can abuse this to cause a denial-of-service condition simply by writing incorrect data over that memory section…there are absolutely no permissions assigned to the shared memory so that anyone can read from and write to it.” Martin Rakhmanov, security research manager for SpiderLabs at Trustwave, elaborated on the PoC for Threatpost. “I show Process Explorer just to illustrate that shared memory is not protected. It is not required to conduct the attack at all,” he said. “The console application just reads the shared memory and thus can access Db2 trace information. It can be modified (the app) to change the Db2 trace as well. Finally, the attacker needs a low-privileged access to the computer where Db2 server is running.” He added, “This is not the same as having control of the machine. So anyone who can connect to the computer where Db2 server is running can read/change the Db2 trace which is not good: On the contrary, the tracing facility requires special privileges inside the Db2 but the vulnerability allows to bypass that.” This shared-memory vulnerability is very similar to one found in the Cisco WebEx Meetings Client on Windows in March (CVE-2020-3347), where any user could read memory dedicated to trace data, Trustwave researchers explained. In that case, any malicious local user or malicious process running on a PC where WebEx is installed can monitor the memory mapped file for a login token. Once found, the token, like any leaked credentials, can be transmitted somewhere so that it can be used to login to the WebEx account in question, download recordings, view/edit meetings and so on. All fix pack levels of IBM Db2 V9.7, V10.1, V10.5, V11.1, and V11.5 editions on all platforms are affected by this latest shared-memory flaw, and users should update to the latest version to fix the issue, the firm said. “This attack could have been widespread, as all Db2 instances of up-to-current version (11.5) on Windows were affected,” Trustwave researchers noted. It’s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks – whether it’s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

"Overall, Adobe patched flaws tied to 42 CVEs as part of its regularly scheduled updates. Adobe has released patches addressing a wave of critical flaws in its Framemaker and Flash Player products, which, if exploited, could lead to arbitrary code-execution. Overall, Adobe stomped out flaws tied to 42 CVEs for its regularly scheduled February updates, with 35 of those flaws being critical in severity. That trumps Adobe’s January security update, which addressed nine vulnerabilities overall, including ones in Adobe Illustrator CC and Adobe Experience Manager. Adobe Framemaker, a document processor designed for writing and editing large or complex documents, including structured documents, took the brunt of this month’s patches with the most (21) critical flaws. “This update addresses multiple critical vulnerabilities,” according to Adobe in its Tuesday update. “Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code-execution in the context of the current user.” The Framemaker flaws stem from buffer errors, or improper restrictions of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CVE-2020-3734); heap overflows, which is a type of buffer overflow that occurs in the heap data area (CVE-2020-3731, CVE-2020-3735); memory-corruption glitches that stem from an unexpected change in the contents of a memory location (CVE-2020-3739, CVE-2020-3740); and out-of-bounds (OOB) write flaws, which are write operations that then produce undefined or unexpected results (CVE-2020-3720, CVE-2020-3721, CVE-2020-3722, CVE-2020-3723, CVE-2020-3724, CVE-2020-3725, CVE-2020-3726, CVE-2020-3727, CVE-2020-3728, CVE-2020-3729, CVE-2020-3730, CVE-2020-3732, CVE-2020-3733, CVE-2020-3736, CVE-2020-3737, CVE-2020-3738). Adobe Framemaker versions 2019.0.4 and below (for Windows) are affected; a patch exists in version 2019.0.5. Adobe Flash Player, meanwhile, has a critical type confusion flaw (CVE-2020-3757) that could enable arbitrary code-execution “in the context of the current user.” Affected products include Adobe Flash Player desktop runtime (for Windows, macOS and Linux), Flash Player for Google Chrome (Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS) and Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and IE 11 (for Windows 10 and 8.1). Users are urged to update to version 32.0.0.330 in a “priority 2” update, which means the update resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically been at elevated risk. This priority level makes sense as Flash is known to be a favorite target for cyberattacks, particularly for exploit kits, zero-day attacks and phishing schemes. Adobe for its part announced in July 2017 that it will no longer update or distribute Flash Player as of the end of 2020, leading to browsers to turn off Flash Player default support. For instance, Mozilla announced it will kill default support for Adobe Flash in Firefox 69, while Google dumped default Flash support in Chrome 76. Adobe Acrobat and Reader, Adobe’s application software and Web services, had critical flaws tied to 12 CVEs, which included a heap overflow flaw enabling arbitrary code execution (CVE-2020-3742), a buffer error glitch allowing arbitrary code execution (CVE-2020-3752 and CVE-2020-3754), use after free errors (which occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed) enabling arbitrary code execution (CVE-2020-3743, CVE-2020-3745, CVE-2020-3746, CVE-2020-3748, CVE-2020-3749, CVE-2020-3750, CVE-2020-3751) and privilege escalation flaws that could allow for arbitrary file system write (CVE-2020-3762 and CVE-2020-3763). Acrobat and Reader also had three important-rated information disclosure flaws and two moderate-rated memory leak vulnerabilities. Users are urged to update to the patched versions (see chart to left for updated versions). Adobe Digital Editions, Adobe’s eBook reader software program, also has a critical and an important flaw in versions 4.5.10 and below. The critical flaw stems from a command-injection glitch (CVE-2020-3760) opening affected systems up to arbitrary code execution. Command-injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (such as forms or HTTP headers) to a system shell. The important flaw is a buffer error (CVE-2020-3759) enabling information disclosure. Users are urged to update to version 4.5.11 for Windows. Finally, Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), its content management solution for building websites, has an important-level uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability (CVE-2020-3741) that could result in a denial-of-service condition. Adobe said that it’s not aware of any exploits in the wild for patched flaws this month.

"A researcher at the Security Analyst Summit described the insecure state Samsung’s Tizen operating system. SINT MAARTEN—Samsung’s Tizen operating system, a strategic stronghold for the company as it attempts to grow its line of homegrown mobile devices, isn’t such a vanguard when it comes to security. An independent researcher has discovered dozens of vulnerabilities in the OS that puts devices such as mobile phones, smart TVs, home appliances and wearables at risk to attack. “It feels like 2005 in terms of the vulnerabilities I found,” said Amihai Neiderman at the Security Analyst Summit. “Tizen is not mature enough to be sent to the public like this. I found a few vulnerabilities in the first few hours of research. A dedicated Tizen researcher could find way more.” Under the hood, Neiderman said, Tizen is essentially Linux with some proprietary add-ons by Samsung around networking and messaging; it has the look and feel of Android on mobile devices. “Samsung is gambling a lot of its success on Tizen,” Neiderman said. “They are laying the groundwork for greater expansion.” While Android is still the primary OS for Samsung phones and tablets, Tizen is creeping on to more connected devices such as smart TVs, and will be at the core of an eventual Tizen-based phone built on Samsung hardware. If Samsung has plans to branch away from Google and compete with it and Apple for mobile share, it will do so on Tizen’s back. The operating system’s security, however, may be an issue it needs to iron out first. Neiderman said that there are zero CVEs for Tizen, and part of his intellectual curiosity around the OS was to be the first to be credited with one. He started with two Tizen-based phones he purchased on eBay from India. The phones are sold only in India, Bangladesh and Nepal for now, but Neiderman said Samsung has already added language support for Sri Lanka, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia and Ghana. Neiderman said that the Tizen store—Samsung’s version of Google Play—was the first worrisome area since its communication protocol contains a check called IsSecureConnectionNeeded?, and that not all messages are sent over SSL. He also found common programming vulnerabilities such as heap overflows, obsolete functions, failures to check array bounds, null dereferences, no stop conditions, no validations of return values and path traversal vulnerabilities. SQL injection vulnerabilities, however, were properly checked and prevented, the researcher said. “Nobody even tried doing a proper code review to this code, if any was done at all,” Neiderman said. “I found 40 bugs, and most of them look exploitable,” Neiderman said. A request for comment from Samsung was not returned in time for publication. : IoT Mobile Security Security Analyst Summit Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1018 Remote System Discovery","<s>[INST] A researcher at the Security Analyst Summit described the insecure state Samsung’s Tizen operating system.

"The RaaS developers thumbed their noses at police, saying \u201cWe find 0 day before you.\u201d The Babuk gang of threat actors claims to have stolen more than 250 gigabytes of data from the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on Monday, including police reports, internal memos, and arrested people\u2019s mug shots and personal details.  According to Vice, the attackers published the claim and the data on the official Babuk site. They also criticized the MPD\u2019s security, and taunted the law enforcement agency by saying that \u201cWe find 0 day before you\u201d in its demand note, and threatened to publish yet more data if their extortion demands aren\u2019t met.  Download \u201cThe Evolution of Ransomware\u201d to gain valuable insights on emerging trends amidst rapidly growing attack volumes. Click above to hone your defense intelligence! \u201cWe will not comment this time: Even such an organization has huge security gaps, we advise them to get in touch as soon as possible and pay us, otherwise we will publish this data,\u201d the attackers reportedly wrote. The outlet reported that Babuk published folders, purportedly filched from the MPD, that are named \u201cGang Conflict Report,\u201d \u201cBLOODS\u201d and \u201cBEEFS \u2013 CONFLICTS.\u201d  An MPD spokesperson acknowledged in an email sent to Threatpost Tuesday morning that the department\u2019s systems had been breached and that it had contacted the FBI. \u201cWe are aware of unauthorized access on our server,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhile we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter.\u201d Another Double-Extortion Try? The MPD hasn\u2019t acknowledged that files were locked, as happens with ransomware. If it turns out that files were in fact encrypted, that would make this yet another double-extortion attempt, where operators not only lock up files, but also steal data and threaten to leak it if the ransom isn\u2019t paid.  Babuk has a history of posting stolen files as a way of applying thumbscrews so victims will pay up: A tactic that\u2019s worked.  According to McAfee, Babuk is a newcomer to this particular crimeware niche, having only been discovered in 2021. But the ransomware has already been lobbed at least five big enterprises, with one score: it walked away with $85,000 after one of those targets ponied up the money, McAfee researchers said. Its victims have included Serco, an outsourcing firm that confirmed that it had been slammed with a double extortion ransomware attack in late January.  Babuk ransomware  operates on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, as in, it gets its affiliates to do the dirty work while its developers take a bite of the profits. According to insight McAfee has gleaned from its telemetry, Babuk is currently targeting the agricultural, electronics, healthcare, plastic and transportation sectors across multiple geographies. McAfee said that we can expect to see more, similar attacks, with the same tactics, given activity in the Dark Web meeting place where Babuk posts its advertisement to recruit affiliates to put its malware into action. Blaming the Victim Cymulate CTO Avihai Ben-Yossef told Threatpost in an email that the Babuk group\u2019s taunts point to the problem with patching lag time. \u201cThe Babuk gang highlighted the key problem that all organizations face when confronting threats, and that is speed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the note to the D.C. Police or MPD, they wrote \u2018we find 0 day before you\u2019. This is unfortunately true, but it doesn\u2019t even have to be a zero day.

Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) on Monday, including police reports, internal memos, and arrested people\u2019s mug shots and personal details.  According to Vice, the attackers published the claim and the data on the official Babuk site. They also criticized the MPD\u2019s security, and taunted the law enforcement agency by saying that \u201cWe find 0 day before you\u201d in its demand note, and threatened to publish yet more data if their extortion demands aren\u2019t met.  Download \u201cThe Evolution of Ransomware\u201d to gain valuable insights on emerging trends amidst rapidly growing attack volumes. Click above to hone your defense intelligence! \u201cWe will not comment this time: Even such an organization has huge security gaps, we advise them to get in touch as soon as possible and pay us, otherwise we will publish this data,\u201d the attackers reportedly wrote. The outlet reported that Babuk published folders, purportedly filched from the MPD, that are named \u201cGang Conflict Report,\u201d \u201cBLOODS\u201d and \u201cBEEFS \u2013 CONFLICTS.\u201d  An MPD spokesperson acknowledged in an email sent to Threatpost Tuesday morning that the department\u2019s systems had been breached and that it had contacted the FBI. \u201cWe are aware of unauthorized access on our server,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWhile we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter.\u201d Another Double-Extortion Try? The MPD hasn\u2019t acknowledged that files were locked, as happens with ransomware. If it turns out that files were in fact encrypted, that would make this yet another double-extortion attempt, where operators not only lock up files, but also steal data and threaten to leak it if the ransom isn\u2019t paid.  Babuk has a history of posting stolen files as a way of applying thumbscrews so victims will pay up: A tactic that\u2019s worked.  According to McAfee, Babuk is a newcomer to this particular crimeware niche, having only been discovered in 2021. But the ransomware has already been lobbed at least five big enterprises, with one score: it walked away with $85,000 after one of those targets ponied up the money, McAfee researchers said. Its victims have included Serco, an outsourcing firm that confirmed that it had been slammed with a double extortion ransomware attack in late January.  Babuk ransomware  operates on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, as in, it gets its affiliates to do the dirty work while its developers take a bite of the profits. According to insight McAfee has gleaned from its telemetry, Babuk is currently targeting the agricultural, electronics, healthcare, plastic and transportation sectors across multiple geographies. McAfee said that we can expect to see more, similar attacks, with the same tactics, given activity in the Dark Web meeting place where Babuk posts its advertisement to recruit affiliates to put its malware into action. Blaming the Victim Cymulate CTO Avihai Ben-Yossef told Threatpost in an email that the Babuk group\u2019s taunts point to the problem with patching lag time. \u201cThe Babuk gang highlighted the key problem that all organizations face when confronting threats, and that is speed,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the note to the D.C. Police or MPD, they wrote \u2018we find 0 day before you\u2019. This is unfortunately true, but it doesn\u2019t even have to be a zero day.

"Phishing and zero-days continue to be a core part of the APT arsenal. Google has registered a significant drop in government-backed cyberattacks against its properties and the people who use its products. Google sends out warnings if it detects that an account is a target of government-backed phishing or malware attempts. For 2019, the internet giant sent almost 40,000 warnings – which, while a large number, is still a nearly 25 percent drop from the year before. Nation-State Trends In terms of trends amongst the warnings, the analysis showed that main targets included, perhaps unsurprisingly, geopolitical rivals, government officials, journalists, dissidents and activists. In 2019, about 20 percent of accounts that received a warning were targeted multiple times by attackers. Google also uncovered that phishing and zero-day exploits continue to be APT weapons of choice. On the former front, Google researchers saw a growing trend emerge towards impersonating news outlets and journalists, especially when it comes to attackers from Iran and North Korea. “For example, attackers impersonate a journalist to seed false stories with other reporters to spread disinformation,” explained Toni Gidwani, security engineering manager at the company’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), writing in an overview of nation-state trends, published last week. “In other cases, attackers will send several benign emails to build a rapport with a journalist or foreign-policy expert before sending a malicious attachment in a follow up email.” On the zero-day front, TAG discovered bugs affecting Android, Chrome, iOS, Internet Explorer and Windows over the course of last year, including CVE-2020-0674. This is a memory-corruption vulnerability disclosed in late January, a critical flaw for most Internet Explorer versions, allowing remote code-execution and complete takeover. Other notable bugs included CVE-2018-8653, CVE-2019-0676, CVE-2019-1367 and CVE-2019-1429 in Internet Explorer; CVE-2019-5786 in Chrome; and CVE-2019-0808 in Windows Kernel. Zero-Day Details Three bugs (CVE-2018-8653, CVE-2019-1367 and CVE-2020-0674) are vulnerabilities inside jscript.dll, Gidwani said. “Therefore all exploits enabled IE8 rendering and used JScript.Compact as JS engine. In most Internet Explorer exploits, attackers abused the Enumerator object in order to gain remote code execution.” Meanwhile, CVE-2019-0676 “enables attackers to reveal presence or non-presence of files on the victim’s computer; this information was later used to decide whether or not a second stage exploit should be delivered,” according to the writeup. And, “the attack vector for CVE-2019-1367 was rather atypical as the exploit was delivered from an Office document abusing the online video embedding feature to load an external URL conducting the exploitation.” In one campaign, a single APT was seen using five zero-day exploits, delivered using watering-hole attacks, links to malicious websites and inemail attachments in targeted spear-phishing campaigns. “Finding this many zero-day exploits from the same actor in a relatively short time frame is rare,” said Gidwani. “The majority of targets we observed were from North Korea or individuals who worked on North Korea-related issues.” Nonetheless, he said that it’s encouraging to see the decline in attacks. “One reason for this decline is that our new protections are working,” said Gidwani. “Attackers’ efforts have been slowed down and they’re more deliberate in their attempts, meaning attempts are happening less frequently as attackers adapt.” Do you suffer from Password Fatigue? On Wednesday April 8 at 2 p.m. ET join Duo Security and Threatpost as we explore a passwordless future.

"Different models of Dell computers have shipped with a preinstalled root certificate and private key, opening the machines up to man-in-the-middle attacks. Update Just in time for Black Friday, various models of new Dell computers are shipping with a preinstalled root certificate and private key that corresponds to the cert, which as of earlier today was being accepted by all major browsers except Firefox. Given that a number of tools exist to aid in the extracting of the private key, it doesn’t figure to be long before attackers can carry out man-in-the-middle attacks, spoof popular websites and unlock encrypted communication. A request made to Dell for comment was not returned in time for publication. Dell said it began loading the cert on consumer and commercial devices in August to speed up online support engagements; the cert provides a support technician necessary system information including the PC model, drivers, and operating system. “The recent situation raised is related to an on-the-box support certificate intended to provide a better, faster and easier customer support experience. Unfortunately, the certificate introduced an unintended security vulnerability,” Dell said in a statement provided to Threatpost. “To address this, we are providing our customers with instructions to permanently remove the certificate from their systems via direct email, on our support site and Technical Support. We are also removing the certificate from all Dell systems moving forward.” Dell also said that commercial customers who image their own systems are not vulnerable. “Dell does not pre-install any adware or malware,” Dell said. “The certificate will not reinstall itself once it is properly removed using the recommended Dell process.” The situation of course harkens back to the Superfish ordeal that plagued Lenovo computers starting last Christmas season before it was finally made public in February. Superfish was bloatware on new Lenovo machines used to install ads in users’ browsers, that also opened the door to abuse leading to man-in-the-middle attacks similar to the Dell situation. So far, the cert—called eDellroot—has been found on Dell XPS 15 laptops, M4800 workstations, and Inspiron desktops and laptops. “It means attackers are de facto certificate authorities, free to generate man-in-the-middle certs, or just direct phishing sites that won’t get flagged as illegitimate,” said researcher Kenneth White, director of the Open Crypto Audit Project. “For these users, it’s as if there’s a bogus equivalent to Verisign, Comodo, or Symantec CA.” White has built a website that checks whether machines are vulnerable to the cert. German security blogger Hanno Bock has also built a similar online check.

At least with Superfish we knew that their rogue root CA was needed to inject ads into your web pages; the reason Dell’s is there is unclear. Joe Nord, a Florida-based computer programmer, also posted a warning on his personal website about a new Dell Inspiron 5000 notebook he purchased last month. “Serial number starts with ‘6b c5 7b 95 18 93 aa 97 4b 62’ and the keys are marked non-exportable.  Notice that this doesn’t mean that the private key isn’t accessible, it only means that it isn’t exportable,” Nord wrote. “Anyone possessing the private key which is on my computer is capable of minting certificates for any site, for any purpose and the computer will programmatically and falsely conclude the issued certificate to be valid.” Bock said the cert is installed by Dell Foundation Services software, which is available on Dell’s website. “Every attacker can use this root certificate to create valid certificates for arbitrary web pages. Even HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) does not protect against such attacks, because browser vendors allow locally installed certificates to override the key pinning protection,” Bock wrote. “This is a compromise in the implementation that allows the operation of so-called TLS interception proxies.” This article was updated on Nov. 23 with comments from Dell.  : Cryptography Privacy Vulnerabilities",T1082 System Information Discovery,"<s>[INST] Different models of Dell computers have shipped with a preinstalled root certificate and private key, opening the machines up to man-in-the-middle attacks.

"versions of the software are affected by a spate of bugs under active exploitations. Microsoft has broken its silence on the recent barrage of attacks on several ProxyShell vulnerabilities in that were highlighted by a researcher at Black Hat earlier this month. The company released an advisory late Wednesday letting customers know that threat actors may use unpatched Exchange servers “to deploy ransomware or conduct other post-exploitation activities” and urging them to update immediately. “Our recommendation, as always, is to install the latest CU and SU on all your Exchange servers to ensure that you are protected against the latest threats,” the company said. “Please update now!” Customers that have installed the May 2021 security updates or the July 2021 security updates on their Exchange servers are protected from these vulnerabilities, as are Exchange Online customers so long as they ensure that all hybrid Exchange servers are updated, the company wrote. “But if you have not installed either of these security updates, then your servers and data are vulnerable,” according to the advisory. The ProxyShell bugs that Devcore principal security researcher Orange Tsai outlined in a presentation at Black Hat. The three vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523, CVE-2021-31207) enable an adversary to trigger remote code execution on Microsoft Exchange servers. Microsoft said the bugs can be exploited in the following cases: –The server is running an older, unsupported CU; –The server is running security updates for older, unsupported versions of Exchange that were released in March 2021; or –The server is running an older, unsupported CU, with the March 2021 EOMT mitigations applied. “In all of the above scenarios, you must install one of latest supported CUs and all applicable SUs to be protected,” according to Microsoft. “Any Exchange servers that are not on a supported CU and the latest available SU are vulnerable to ProxyShell and other attacks that leverage older vulnerabilities.” Sounding the Alarm Following Tsai’s presentation on the bugs, the SANS Internet Storm Center’s Jan Kopriva reported that he found more than 30,000 vulnerable Exchange servers via a Shodan scan and that any threat actor worthy of that title would find exploiting then easy to execute, given how much information is available. Security researchers at Huntress also reported seeing ProxyShell vulnerabilities being actively exploited throughout the month of August to install backdoor access once the ProxyShell exploit code was published on Aug. 6. But starting last Friday, Huntress reported a “surge” in attacks after finding 140 webshells launched against 1,900 unpatched Exchange servers. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) joined those sounding the alarm over the weekend, issuing an urgent alert. They, too, urged organizations to immediately install the latest Microsoft Security Update. At the time, researcher Kevin Beaumont expressed criticism over Microsoft’s messaging efforts surrounding the vulnerability and the urgent need for its customers to update their Exchange Server security. “Microsoft decided to downplay the importance of the patches and treat them as a standard monthly Exchange patch, which [has] been going on for – obviously – decades,” Beaumont explained. But Beaumont said these remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities are “…as serious as they come.” He noted that the company did not help matters by failing to allocate CVEs for them until July — four months after the patches were issued. In order of patching priority, according to Beaumont, the vulnerabilities are: CVE-2021–34473, CVE-2021–34523 and CVE-2021–31207.

"Justin Jett, director of audit and compliance for Plixer, discusses the transformation of network-traffic analytics and what it means for cybersecurity now. Last year, Gartner published a market guide on network detection and response (NDR). Formerly known as network-traffic analytics, which I\u2019ve spoken about in the past at length, NDR has adapted to not only play a major role in helping network and security teams identify threats, but it has enabled these teams to respond to them too. This change in name means that network data is becoming more and more important in stopping threats and is a key component to a multi-layered security posture. With this in mind, what does NDR mean for the future of cybersecurity as we prepare for the rest of 2021? Cybercriminals Still Hack Humans While technology evolves, and network and security professionals develop more sophisticated techniques to stop attacks, one thing remains true: Humans are still a big problem in the equation. Truthfully, humans are still the biggest problem (check out this article nearby on how to deal with some of these problems when you have fewer resources). A recent post by Fortinet shows that social engineering and phishing are still major contributors to attacks. Specifically, timely attacks are often extremely effective at exposing individual\u2019s vulnerability and enables cybercriminals to take advantage of people. This is so much the case that the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) posted a \u201cVerify Your Valentine\u201d notice ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day to help reduce the number of people that fall victim to cybercriminals. And, another article posted by Nevada IT Solutions highlights how human negligence is a major contributor to cyberthreats. Even outside of the intricate Valentine scams, as the number of people working from home has increased (and for the most part remains at an all-time high), the vulnerabilities have also increased as businesses have had to adapt standards to include remote/home networks attached to the business. All the while, cybercriminals have been continuously building their attacks as the world managed around COVID-19. Some Big Changes to Business Fortunately, there does seem to some light at the end of the tunnel around these kinds of attacks. As network-traffic analytics has moved to NDR \u2014 largely thanks to machine-learning improvements\u2014businesses have been planning for major changes in cybersecurity, according to a recent article in Forbes. Specifically, 96 percent of enterprise executives are planning to adjust their cybersecurity strategies, and 55 percent indicate an increase in cybersecurity budgets. The biggest thing is that the new strategies will rely more and more on \u201cautomated, adaptive cybersecurity.\u201d This is precisely what NDR is built around: Taking network traffic metadata and using machine learning and/or artificial intelligence to quickly identify threats and automate the response. This is great news because the human problem is not only the problem for how cyberattacks are allowed on a network, but the human problem can also be attributed to how cyberattacks are missed once they are on the network. Solving for Humans: Post-Attack As the number of false positives increases in a given cybersecurity platform, the likelihood that a person looking at those alerts will ignore or miss a real threat also increases. This is just a simple math problem, since people can only ingest so much data before being overloaded and the noise takes over. To solve this problem, network and security teams need a system that will provide them with the fewest alerts and that provides context to help understand the nature and severity of the threat. In a recent CSO article, among other things, it\u2019s problematic if \u201ca metric doesn\u2019t provide any context as to whether it\u2019s good or bad, or leaves you and your team unsure of how to derive meaning and act on it.\u201d This is particularly a problem for log-aggregation systems like those provided by security information and event management (SIEM) systems, because log data provides extremely factual information, but no insight as to what it means. Usually one needs to dig much further into other systems to find an answer. This exacerbates the issue, because in the short amount of time available for IT teams in a day, digging deeply into multiple systems to find a problem can add additional blindness to the team. Instead, network and security teams should come together to share valuable network data in a system that not only provides a low number of false positives (most vendors will say that they can do this), but that also enables actionable and contextual insight into attacks. An added bonus is enabled automated responses, but it may take some time before security and network professionals are willing to let machine-learning algorithms determine when to make network changes or quarantine devices on the network. Until then, NDR systems will continue to provide a platform to reduce the human challenges of creating havoc on the network and not identifying the problem quickly enough once those threats appear.  2021 is shaping up to be the year of NDR, and that just might make the human problem less of a problem.

Last year, Gartner published a market guide on network detection and response (NDR). Formerly known as network-traffic analytics, which I\u2019ve spoken about in the past at length, NDR has adapted to not only play a major role in helping network and security teams identify threats, but it has enabled these teams to respond to them too. This change in name means that network data is becoming more and more important in stopping threats and is a key component to a multi-layered security posture. With this in mind, what does NDR mean for the future of cybersecurity as we prepare for the rest of 2021? Cybercriminals Still Hack Humans While technology evolves, and network and security professionals develop more sophisticated techniques to stop attacks, one thing remains true: Humans are still a big problem in the equation. Truthfully, humans are still the biggest problem (check out this article nearby on how to deal with some of these problems when you have fewer resources). A recent post by Fortinet shows that social engineering and phishing are still major contributors to attacks. Specifically, timely attacks are often extremely effective at exposing individual\u2019s vulnerability and enables cybercriminals to take advantage of people. This is so much the case that the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) posted a \u201cVerify Your Valentine\u201d notice ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day to help reduce the number of people that fall victim to cybercriminals.

"A week after admitting that several of its security appliances ship with static SSH keys, Cisco warned customers on Wednesday that its Unified Communications Domain Manager platform has a default, static password for an account that carries root privileges. The vulnerability affects versions of the software prior to 4.4.5 and the company said there are no workarounds for it. An attacker who is able to find a vulnerable device would be able to connect to it over SSH and gain complete control of the device. “A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to login with the privileges of the root user and take full control of the affected system,” the Cisco advisory says. “The vulnerability occurs because a privileged account has a default and static password. This account is created at installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system via SSH using this account. An exploit could allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.” A year ago, Cisco said that the same UCDM product included a default private SSH key that is stored insecurely. “The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default SSH private key, which is stored in an insecure way on the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH private key. For example, the attacker might reverse engineer the binary file of the operating system. This will allow the attacker to connect by using the support account to the system without requiring any form of authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the system with the privileges of the root user,” the advisory from July 2014 says.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes This should come as a surprise, a mild or perhaps not-so-mild shock, to those many people who lock their computer screens while temporarily moving away. Well, your system, your data is not secure when you do so. It’s just a USB device that’s needed to steal critical data from your locked system. This might be news for many, as regards PC security. Security expert Rob Fuller has now explained that it’s very easy to copy an OS account password hash from a locked computer using a special USB device, and that too in a few seconds. This hash can then be cracked or used directly in network attacks. Rob, who has over a decade’s experience covering all aspects of information security, has explained this in detail in a post that he has made on his website www.room362.com. Rob Fuller has proved this using a flash-drive-size computer device called USB Armory that costs $155, but he has also stated that it can be done using other cheaper devices as well. Says Rob Fuller- “I started off with a USB Armory ($155) but below I’ll show you how to do this with a Hak5 Turtle ($49.99) as well.” How it works All that it takes is to plug in a device that masquerades as a USB Ethernet adapter in such a way that it becomes the primary network interface on the locked computer that’s targeted. This is rather easy because firstly, even if a computer is locked, OSs automatically start installing newly connected USB devices, including Ethernet cards, and secondly, the OSs automatically configure such devices as the default gateways. Says Rob Fuller in his website post- “USB is Plug-and-Play. This means that even if a system is locked out, the device still gets installed. Now, I believe there are restrictions on what types of devices are allowed to install at a locked out state on newer operating systems (Win10/El Capitan), but Ethernet/LAN is definitely on the white list.” When a new network card gets installed, the Operating System would configure it to automatically detect the network settings. This is done through the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and anyone wishing to steal data from a locked computer can have a rogue computer at the other end of the Ethernet cable to act as a DHCP server. When it’s a USB Armory that’s used, it becomes easier because USB Armory works like a computer on a stick, powered via USB and running on Linux. Thus, there is no need to attach a separate rogue machine. Thus, the attacker happens to gain control of a computer’s network settings using the USB device. He thus also can control the system’s DNS (Domain Name System) responses and is able to configure a rogue internet proxy through the WPAD (Web Proxy Autodiscovery) protocol and more. Thereby he attains an advantageous man-in-the-middle position, which he can utilize to intercept and tamper with the computer’s network traffic. As Rob Fuller says- “Computers are constantly creating traffic, even if you don’t have any browsers or applications open, and most computers trust their local network…” Thus, it becomes possible for the attacker who makes his entry into the system using the USB device to extract the account name and the hashed password. The capturing of credentials from a locked system in this manner can be done in a short time. Rob Fuller says he needed only about 13 seconds for his test attack. The stolen password hashes would either be in the in NT LAN Manager (NTLM) version 2 or NTLMv1 format, based on the targeted computer and its configuration. NTLMv2 hashes, though harder to crack, can be cracked if the password is not too complex and the hacker uses a powerful password cracking rig. Moreover, there are some instances where relay attacks against network services can be made possible by using NTLM hashes directly without having to know plaintext passwords. So, next time you move away leaving your computer locked, remember that someone can very easily get away with your credentials and shatter your concepts regarding PC security.

"Citizen Lab urges Apple users to update immediately. The new zero-click zero-day ForcedEntry flaw affects all things Apple: iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. Apple users should immediately update all their devices – iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches – to install an emergency patch for a zero-click zero-day exploited by NSO Group to install spyware. The security updates, pushed out by Apple on Monday, include iOS 14.8 for iPhones and iPads, as well as new updates for Apple Watch and macOS. The patches will fix at least one vulnerability that the tech behemoth said “may have been actively exploited.” Citizen Lab first discovered the never-before-seen, zero-click exploit, which it detected targeting iMessaging, last month. It’s allegedly been used to illegally spy on Bahraini activists with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, according to the cybersecurity watchdog. The digital researchers dubbed the new iMessaging exploit ForcedEntry. Citizen Group said in August that they had identified nine Bahraini activists whose iPhones were inflicted with Pegasus spyware between June 2020 and February 2021. Some of the activists’ phones suffered zero-click iMessage attacks that, besides ForcedEntry, also included the 2020 KISMET exploit. The activists included three members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political society), three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society), Citizen Lab wrote. The ForcedEntry exploit was particularly notable in that it was successfully deployed against the latest iOS versions – 14.4 & 14.6 – blowing past Apple’s new BlastDoor sandboxing feature to install spyware on the iPhones of the Bahraini activists. Citizen Lab first observed NSO Group deploying ForcedEntry in February 2021. Apple had just introduced BlastDoor, a structural improvement in iOS 14 meant to block message-based, zero-click exploits like these NSO Group-associated attacks – the month before. BlastDoor was supposed to prevent this type of Pegasus attack by acting as what Google Project Zero’s Samuel Groß called a “tightly sandboxed” service responsible for “almost all” of the parsing of untrusted data in iMessages. In a post on Monday, Citizen Lab researchers said that in March 2021, they had examined the phone of a Saudi activist who requested anonymity and determined that the phone had been infected with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. Last Tuesday, Sept. 7, Citizen Lab forwarded artifacts from two types of crashes on another phone that had been infected with Pegasus, suspecting that both infections showed parts of the ForcedEntry exploit chain. Citizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, Sept. 7. On Monday, Sept. 13, Apple confirmed that the files included a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. Apple has designated the ForcedEntry exploit CVE-2021-30860: an as-yet-unrated flaw that Apple describes as “processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code execution.” Sniffing out NSO Group’s Tracks Citizen Lab described several distinct elements that gives researchers high confidence that the exploit can be tied to the secretive Israeli spyware maker NSO Group, including a forensic artifact called CascadeFail. CascadeFail is a bug whereby “evidence is incompletely deleted from the phone’s DataUsage.sqlite file,” according to Citizen Lab. In CascadeFail, “an entry from the file’s ZPROCESS table is deleted, but not entries in the ZLIVEUSAGE table that refer to the deleted ZPROCESS entry,” they described. That has NSO Group’s fingerprints, they said: “We have only ever seen this type of incomplete deletion associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware, and we believe that the bug is distinctive enough to point back to NSO.” Another telltale sign: multiple process names installed by the ForcedEntry exploit, including the name “setframed”. That process name was used in an attack with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware on an Al Jazeera journalist in July 2020, according to Citizen Lab: a detail that the watchdog didn’t reveal at the time. Zero click remote exploits such as the novel method used by Pegasus spyware to invisibly infect an Apple device without the victim’s knowledge or the need for the victim to click on anything at all were used to infect one victim for as long as six months. They’re pure gold to governments, mercenaries and criminals who want to secretly surveil targets’ devices without being detected. Pegasus is a powerful spyware: it can turn on a target’s camera and microphone so as to record messages, texts, emails, and calls, even if they’re sent via encrypted messaging apps such as Signal. Pegasus’s Threadbare Narrative NSO has long maintained that it only sells its spyware to a handful of intelligence communities within countries that have been thoroughly vetted for human rights violations. The company has repeatedly tried to keep up that narrative, taking the tactic of questioning Citizen Lab’s methods and motives. But, as pointed out by Hank Schless, Senior Manager of security solutions at endpoint-to-cloud security company Lookout, the narrative is now pretty threadbare. “The recent exposure of 50,000 phone numbers linked to targets of NSO Group customers was all people needed to see right through what NSO claims,” he told Threatpost on Monday. “Since Lookout and The Citizen Lab first discovered Pegasus back in 2016, it has continued to evolve and take on new capabilities,” he elaborated. “It can now be deployed as a zero-click exploit, which means that the target user doesn’t even have to tap a malicious link for the surveillanceware to be installed. While the malware has adjusted its delivery methods, the basic exploit chain remains the same, Schless continued. “Pegasus is delivered via a malicious link that’s been socially engineered to the target, the vulnerability is exploited and the device is compromised, then the malware communicated back to a command-and-control (C2) server that gives the attacker free reign over the device. Many apps will automatically create a preview or cache of links in order to improve the user experience. Pegasus takes advantage of this functionality to silently infect the device.” Schless said that this is an example of how important it is for both individuals and enterprise organizations to have visibility into the risks their mobile devices present, Pegasus being just onei “extreme, but easily understandable example. “There are countless pieces of malware out there that can easily exploit known device and software vulnerabilities to gain access to your most sensitive data,” he continued. “From an enterprise perspective, leaving mobile devices out of the greater security strategy can represent a major gap in the ability to protect the entire infrastructure from malicious actors. Once the attacker has control of a mobile device or even compromises the user’s credentials, they have free access to your entire infrastructure. Once they enter your cloud or on-prem apps, they can move laterally and identify sensitive assets to encrypt for a ransomware attack or exfiltrate to sell to the highest bidder.” Kevin Dunne, president at unified access orchestration provider Pathlock, noted that the Pegasus infections point to the need for businesses to look beyond securing servers and workstations as primary targets for cyberattacks and espionage. “Mobile devices are now used broadly and contain sensitive information that needs to be protected,” he explained. To protect themselves against spyware, businesses should look at their mobile device security strategy, Dunne said – particularly when threats come in forms that are far more insidious than suspicious SMS messages or phishy links that security teams can train users to avoid. “Spyware attackers have now engineered zero click attacks which are able to get full access to a phone’s data and microphone/camera by using vulnerabilities in third party apps or even built-in applications,” Dunne said. “Organizations need to make sure they have control over what applications users download on to their phones, and can ensure they are up to date so any vulnerabilities are patched.” It’s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

While the malware has adjusted its delivery methods, the basic exploit chain remains the same, Schless continued. “Pegasus is delivered via a malicious link that’s been socially engineered to the target, the vulnerability is exploited and the device is compromised, then the malware communicated back to a command-and-control (C2) server that gives the attacker free reign over the device. Many apps will automatically create a preview or cache of links in order to improve the user experience. Pegasus takes advantage of this functionality to silently infect the device.” Schless said that this is an example of how important it is for both individuals and enterprise organizations to have visibility into the risks their mobile devices present, Pegasus being just onei “extreme, but easily understandable example. “There are countless pieces of malware out there that can easily exploit known device and software vulnerabilities to gain access to your most sensitive data,” he continued. “From an enterprise perspective, leaving mobile devices out of the greater security strategy can represent a major gap in the ability to protect the entire infrastructure from malicious actors. Once the attacker has control of a mobile device or even compromises the user’s credentials, they have free access to your entire infrastructure. Once they enter your cloud or on-prem apps, they can move laterally and identify sensitive assets to encrypt for a ransomware attack or exfiltrate to sell to the highest bidder.” Kevin Dunne, president at unified access orchestration provider Pathlock, noted that the Pegasus infections point to the need for businesses to look beyond securing servers and workstations as primary targets for cyberattacks and espionage. “Mobile devices are now used broadly and contain sensitive information that needs to be protected,” he explained. To protect themselves against spyware, businesses should look at their mobile device security strategy, Dunne said – particularly when threats come in forms that are far more insidious than suspicious SMS messages or phishy links that security teams can train users to avoid. “Spyware attackers have now engineered zero click attacks which are able to get full access to a phone’s data and microphone/camera by using vulnerabilities in third party apps or even built-in applications,” Dunne said. “Organizations need to make sure they have control over what applications users download on to their phones, and can ensure they are up to date so any vulnerabilities are patched.” It’s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

"A Microsoft Word zero-day vulnerability is being used to spread the Dridex banking Trojan in attacks that have bypassed mitigation efforts. Microsoft on Tuesday released a patch for a zero-day vulnerability that was discovered late last week and used to spread the Dridex banking Trojan. Attacks were spreading via a massive spam campaign where emails contain Microsoft Word documents with malicious attachments that exploited a vulnerability in the way Microsoft handles OLE2Link objects. According to researchers, the attacks were effective at bypassing most mitigation efforts. The patch was part of Microsoft’s scheduled Patch Tuesday software updates. “This is the first campaign we have observed that leverages the newly disclosed Microsoft zero-day,” Proofpoint wrote in a technical analysis of the zero day. “This represents a significant level of agility and innovation for Dridex actors.” The Microsoft zero-day vulnerability, according to Proofpoint, was extremely effective. “When recipients open the document, the exploit–if successful–is used to carry out a series of actions that lead to the installation of Dridex botnet ID 7500 on the user’s system,” researchers wrote. “The Microsoft OLE2Link object can open application data based on the server-provided MIME type, which can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system,” according an advisory released by the DHS-sponsored CERT hosted at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The zero-day, first reported by McAfee on Friday, is notable because in most cases macro-laden documents attached to emails are blocked by mitigations built into Office and Microsoft’s Windows 10. In this case, users also do not have to enable macros for the exploit to execute. In a test by Proofpoint, a system was exploited just by opening an Office 2010 document. As the document opened, users were presented with a dialogue box that asked “This document contains links that may refer to other files. Do you want to update this document with the data from the linked files?” According to Proofpoint, “user interaction was not required” and once the dialogue box appeared, the Dridex malware injection process began. The attack involves a Microsoft Office RTF document that contain an embedded OLE2link object. “When the user opens the document, winword.exe issues a HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a malicious .hta file, which appears as a fake RTF file,” according to an analysis of the zero day by FireEye researchers. The HTA application then loads and executes malicious scripts that halt the winword.exe loading process. Next, the scripts download payloads and load a decoy document for the user to see, according to FireEye. “The original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the OLE2link,” FireEye researcher wrote. “Clearly the fact that the RTF file is able download the malicious HTML that enables local execution of malware points to a lack of control in interpreting untrusted input from the outside world,” said Paul Farrington, manager of EMEA Solution Architects at Veracode. “The Microsoft engineers will not only need to devise a patch for this vulnerability, but also to remodel their threat assessment of this type of file interaction,” Farrington said. The spam campaigns delivering the zero day spoofed the recipient’s domain in the sender’s email address and appear to be from either “copier”, “documents”, “noreply”, “no-reply”, or “scanner”. The subject line in all cases is “Scan Data” and included attachments named “Scan_123456.doc” or “Scan_123456.pdf” – with the numbers randomly generated. The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office, including the latest Office 2016 edition running on Windows 10. Mitigation includes installing the Microsoft patch. However, Microsoft notes “you must have the release version of Service Pack 2 for Office 2010 installed on the computer” to apply the security update. Alternatively, security experts recommend blocking RTF documents in Microsoft Word via the File Block Settings in the Microsoft Office Trust Center. They also recommend using Microsoft Office Protected View, which they say can help prevent exploitation without user interaction. : Hacks Malware Privacy Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1021 Remote Services,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] A Microsoft Word zero-day vulnerability is being used to spread the Dridex banking Trojan in attacks that have bypassed mitigation efforts.

"Most respondents in a recent survey say they’re losing the battle despite having up-to-date protections in place. IT managers feel overwhelmed by the volume of cyberattack attempts, with most of them admitting that successful hacks of their company networks are becoming the norm. That’s according to a research report The Impossible Puzzle of Cybersecurity, released Friday. In a survey of 3,100 IT managers across 12 countries (at organizations with 100 to 5,000 employees), two out of three of them said their organizations (68 percent) suffered a cyberattack in 2018, despite efforts to prevent them. This, despite the fact that a full 26 percent of IT’S time, on average, is spent on cybersecurity issues. Nine out of 10 (91 percent) of respondents said they were running up-to-date cybersecurity protections at the time of a successful attack, according to the Sophos, who published the report. “This reveals that, despite good intentions and behaviors, threats are getting through,” according to the report, released Friday. “This may be through weaknesses in the cybersecurity, or because there are security holes that haven’t been plugged or gaps in their protection – while an organization might have been running up-to-date endpoint protection, this doesn’t mean all other devices were secure.” The survey also showed that attacks are coming via multiple channels, including email (accounting for 33 percent) and web (30 percent), software vulnerabilities (23 percent), unauthorized USB sticks or other external devices (14 percent), and more. However, worryingly, a fifth (20 percent) of IT managers said they didn’t know how their networks were compromised. In terms of the attacks that succeeded, over half of them (53 percent) were phishing attacks; a third (35 percent) resulted in malware infections; another 35 percent pointed to software exploits; and 30 percent said they were hit with ransomware. IT managers consider their greatest risk to be phishing mails (50 percent flagged this as the number-one threat), followed by software exploits (45 percent). Third on the list is people, including internal staff, contractors and visitors. “We humans are ranked a top-three security concern by 44 percent of respondents, and clearly present IT teams with quite a different type of cybersecurity challenge,” the report noted. Wi-Fi security also weighs heavily on the minds of IT managers, with more than a third (36%) ranking it as a top-three concern, followed by unknown devices (31 percent). Click to enlarge. IT managers surveyed also mentioned a shortage of key skills on staff, which makes it that much harder to keep up with the volume of incidents and the scope of risks. Most respondents (86 percent) said that they needed more skills to combat threats, but 80 percent also said that they struggled to recruit the right people. Two-thirds of respondents said that their budgets for people and technology were too low. Unsurprisingly, the inability to fend off attacks has led to significant concerns on the part of IT managers: Data loss was the number one concern for 31 percent of respondents, followed by cost and damage to the business (21 percent).

"The company has patched a vulnerability that could allow malicious sites unauthorized access to usernames and passwords. LastPass has patched a bug that could potentially allow malicious websites to access a web user’s credentials from a previously visited site. Tavis Ormandy, a vulnerability researcher from Google Project Zero, discovered the flaw in the LastPass password manager and published it on the project’s website on Aug. 29, rating it as “high.” He followed that up with a Twitter post warning web users about the bug on Sunday. “LastPass could leak the last used credentials due to a cache not being updated,” Ormandy Tweeted. “This was because you can bypass the tab credential cache being populated by including the login form in an unexpected way!” In other words, if a web user running LastPass entered credentials to one site and then surfed to another, the second site could have unauthorized access the username and password from the first site. If the second site is malicious, it could put the user at risk of cybercriminals. Between the bug’s discovery and Ormandy’s Twitter announcement of the vulnerability, LastPass said it fixed the bug in a blog post dated Sept. 13. The company also diminished its severity. “To exploit this bug, a series of actions would need to be taken by a LastPass user including filling a password with the LastPass icon, then visiting a compromised or malicious site and finally being tricked into clicking on the page several times,” according to the post attributed to Security Engineering Manager Ferenc Kun. “This exploit may result in the last site credentials filled by LastPass to be exposed.” Kun said LastPass deployed the update to all browsers, even though the vulnerability Ormandy discovered was “limited” to Chrome and Opera. The company also confirmed with Ormandy that the solution was “comprehensive,” Kun added. “We have now resolved this bug; no user action is required and your LastPass browser extension will update automatically,” he wrote in the post. Security experts recommend that Web users running LastPass ensure that the version of the software they’re running is 4.33 or later. The bug isn’t the first that Ormandy discovered in the password management software. The Google researcher has been keeping LastPass’s security team on its toes in recent years. In 2017, LastPass was prompted to patch three bugs that could allow for password theft thanks to Ormandy’s detective work. The year before that, Ormandy discovered a vulnerability in the password manager’s Firefox add-on that allows attackers remotely compromise it, which LastPass also subsequently fixed.

"Embedded device security emerged as front page news during the recently wrapped up Black Hat and DEF CON events. LAS VEGAS — At the risk of diving headfirst into the Internet of Things fray, embedded device security emerged as a shiny new penny during last week’s Black Hat and DEF CON festivities. Firmware is the new hacker black, and everything from USB sticks, to home routers, to automobiles is in play for exploits, data theft and privacy erosion. While it may take a bit more ingenuity to crack one of these tiny computers, the frightening fact is that once owned, many are owned for good because they don’t have automatic update mechanisms and require user intervention to apply patches. And that’s bad news when Charlie Miller is at the control of your car from a laptop 100 meters away, or Karsten Nohl, above with Jakob Lell, entices you to drop a memory stick containing his BadUSB attack onto your machine. Security is definitely growing up, and Black Hat is that annual checkpoint that defines and demonstrates where researchers are poking around. A short 12 months ago, Web security was the star of the show with hackers abusing online ad networks to spread exploits, or stealing browser data with JavaScript-based timing attacks. We were in the throes of the Snowden revelations last August, and crypto talks and updates and demos to SSL attacks such as BREACH were made for headlines. This year, the worm wiggled in a different direction. Now that everything has an IP address and an embedded Linux machine running inside, the safety of those devices and the potential consequences of an attack merited careful scrutiny. Nohl’s BadUSB research attacks the ubiquity of the USB form factor, and destroys the inherent trust users have in its universality. BadUSB is the name Nohl, chief scientist at Security Research Labs, gave to code he’s written that overwrites firmware to do the attacker’s bidding, such as loading malicious code or diverting traffic. “USB is designed to work like this; no one did anything wrong,” Nohl said. “And there’s no way to fix it. As long as we have USBs, we can have devices masquerading as other devices. It’s a structural security issue.” Nohl’s attack is not only against the firmware present on USB devices, but also against its standardization and versatility. Billions of devices are potentially impacted. “This has the potential to spread unnecessary suspicion. You may never know which USBs are infected, and even if it’s a small percentage of devices that are infected, there is the potential to stop trusting the technology,” Nohl said. “There is no cleansing tool that removes the malicious firmware, or overwrites it. This makes infections easier, and makes it harder recovering from infections.” The real gotcha with Nohl’s work is that it could be in the wild already.

After that experiment, I will never claim again that the NSA or others aren’t using it. This is great potential for panic; if it’s anywhere, it could be everywhere.” With Nohl’s work, we’re talking about the impact on privacy and personal liberties, while with Miller and cohort Chris Valasek, personal safety is the issue. Granted it’s difficult and requires a sizeable upfront investment to research automobile vulnerabilities – you have to buy the car, not to mention void the warranty – Miller and Valasek took their work up a notch and talked about the hurdles an attacker would have to scale in order to remotely hack a car. “If you pop my computers or phones and steal my credit card numbers or dump my email, I can come back from that,” Valasek said. “But a car, on the other hand, if someone attacks that, it’s not going to be opportunistic. A lot of research, time and money goes into it, and it can result in physical harm.” The duo explained how they can target Bluetooth and the numerous remote sensors on today’s modern automobiles to possibly manipulate its steering, braking and other safety features. Car makers, meanwhile, may be simplifying their attack avenues shortly by adding apps and browsers to cars. Rather than targeting just embedded systems, hackers may soon be able to do it the old-fashioned way and SQL injection their way in. “Once you add a browser to a car, it’s over,” Valasek said. “A lot more people know how to write a Web exploit than a [tire pressure monitoring system] exploit.

"With human error being the common factor in most cyberattacks, employee training has got to get better. To that end, Trustwave cybersec training expert Darren Van Booven explains the importance of fish stress balls and management buy-in. Log4j, ransomware, cloud vulnerabilities, phishing: Cyber threats are manifold. They all pale, however, in comparison to the security black holes that walk around on two legs. Studies have shown that nearly all successful breaches stem from human error, be it failure to install security patches before an attacker exploits a vulnerability, lousy passwords, or falling into the web of lies spun in social engineering or phishing attacks. A 2020 report from Stanford University found that nine out 10 data breaches are caused by users. Research from Stanford University and the security firm Tessian found that approximately 88 percent of all data breaches are caused by an employee mistake. Similar studies have confirmed these results going back for years: A 2014 report from IBM found that human error was “a major contributing cause” in 95 percent of all breaches. (Brought to you by SpecOps. Underwriters of Threatpost podcasts do not assert any editorial control over content.) According to IBM, the average cost of those breaches has been doubling yearly from 2020 to date.You can install cutting-edge artificial intelligence solutions or other modern anti-malware and threat detection software to detect anomalous behavior, but technical solutions only go so far, given that carbon-based life forms use them.  With massive social engineering attacks such as the Twitter hack and phishing attacks pushing ransomware – such as those following the Colonial Pipeline attack – it’s imperative for organizations to generate buy-in from executives for strong cybersecurity awareness and training programs that reach all employees. However, these programs often aren’t tailored to individuals’ roles and responsibilities. They also tend to be boring. Darren Van Booven, lead principal consultant at Trustwave and cybersecurity training expert, visited the Threatpost podcast to talk about how the right cybersecurity awareness program should be conducted at the right pace by well-informed instructors. What also doesn’t hurt: getting senior management to support decent cybersecurity training programs, bringing in notable speakers, making sure management is role-modeling good security hygiene, casting coworkers in cybersecurity awareness skits and/or passing out squeezie stress-balls shaped like phish.

"The client’s default configuration for SSL-VPN has a certificate issue, researchers said. Default configurations of Fortinet’s FortiGate VPN appliance could open organizations to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, according to researchers, where threat actors could intercept important data. According to the SAM IoT Security Lab, the FortiGate SSL-VPN client only verifies that the certificate used for client authentication was issued by Fortinet or another trusted certificate authority. “Therefore, an attacker can easily present a certificate issued to a different FortiGate router without raising any flags, and implement a man-in-the-middle attack,” researchers wrote, in an analysis on Thursday. They added, “An attacker can actually use this to inject his own traffic, and essentially communicate with any internal device in the business, including point of sales, sensitive data centers, etc. This is a major security breach, that can lead to severe data exposure.” A Shodan search turned up more than 230,000 vulnerable FortiGate appliances using the VPN functionality, researchers found. Out of those, a full 88 percent, or more than 200,000 businesses, are using the default configuration and can be easily breached in an MitM attack. Underneath the Hood According to SAM, in a typical SSL certificate verification process, the client can connect to a server only after verifying that the certificate’s Server Name field matches the actual name of the server that the client is attempting to connect to; that the certificate validity date has not passed; that the digital signature is correct; and that the certificate was issued by an authority that the client trusts. In the case of the FortiGate router, it uses a self-signed, default SSL certificate, and it uses the router’s serial number to denote the server for the certificate – it does not, according to SAM, verify that the actual server name parameter matches. “This leaves Fortinet with enough information to verify the certificate was issued to the same server the client is trying to connect to, if it were to verify the serial number,” according to researchers. “However, Fortinet’s client does not verify the Server Name at all. In fact, any certificate will be accepted, so long as it is valid.” SAM published a proof-of-concept (PoC) how an attacker could easily re-route the traffic to a malicious server, displaying his or her own certificate, and then decrypt the traffic. “We decrypt the traffic of the Fortinet SSL-VPN client and extract the user’s password and [one-time password],” researchers explained. Fixing the Issue While the issue exists in the default configuration of the FortiGard SSL-VPN client, Fortinet does not consider the issue to be a vulnerability, because users have the ability to manually replace the certificate in order to secure their connections appropriately. “The security of our customers is our first priority. This is not a vulnerability,” the firm told Threatpost. “Fortinet VPN appliances are designed to work out-of-the-box for customers so that organizations are enabled to set up their appliance customized to their own unique deployment. Each VPN appliance and the set up process provides multiple clear warnings in the GUI with documentation offering guidance on certificate authentication and sample certificate authentication and configuration examples. Fortinet strongly recommends adhering to its provided installation documentation and process, paying close attention to warnings throughout that process to avoid exposing the organization to risk.” SAM researchers noted that Fortinet’s approach “may be reasonable for the enterprise space,” but “smaller businesses (for example a small law firm) may not have the knowledge or time to configure it.” They added, “the Fortigate issue is only an example of the current issues with security for the small-medium businesses, especially during the epidemic work-from-home routine. These types of businesses require near-enterprise grade security these days, but do not have the resources and expertise to maintain enterprise security systems.” : IoT Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] The client’s default configuration for SSL-VPN has a certificate issue, researchers said.

"Sindhi-language characters can crash iPhones and other iOS/macOS devices if a victim views texts, Twitter posts or messages within various apps containing them. Apple devices are vulnerable to a “text bomb” attack where simply looking at messages or posts containing characters in the Sindhi language can crash devices. Sindhi is an official language used in Pakistan. The bug affects iPhone, iPad, Macs and Apple Watches, and arises from macOS and iOS failing to properly render a Unicode symbol used when writing in the language. Because the symbol confuses the operating systems, according to a Friday post from researcher Graham Cluley at Bitdefender, the devices simply spontaneously crash when it shows up in a viewing window. The problem occurs in a number of different scenarios, including if the character string shows up in a text message – in fact, just looking at a message notification containing a message preview will crash the system. Viewing messages within apps leads to the same outcome, as does reading social media posts on one’s phone or Mac. As for the latter point, Threatpost editors were able to independently confirm that looking at tweets containing the characters will indeed shut down an iPhone. Cluley noted that completely rebooting the device fixes the problem – until another booby-trapped message comes along. The issue was first reported on Reddit on Thursday, and given the moniker “CapturetheFlag” because the offending characters are often paired with the Italian flag (the flag though is not necessary to trigger a crash). Trigger messages began being circulated in Telegram messages, and quickly went viral on Twitter, with many pranksters posting tweets containing the text-bomb content. Apple has had similar linguistic issues in the past; in 2013, certain combinations of Arabic characters were found to crash Macs and iPhones; while in 2018, messages containing letters of the south Indian language of Telugu were discovered to do the same thing. Other text-bomb attacks that don’t relate to Unicode symbols have made the rounds in the past: The chaiOS bug in 2018 for instance allowed attackers to crash or freeze phones just by sending a text message containing a hyperlink to malicious code hosted on GitHub. Recipients only needed to receive the malicious messages for the flaw to work: Clicking on the link wasn’t required. And last year, an Apple iMessage bug made the rounds that allowed attackers to brick iPhones running older iOS versions, by sending a specially crafted message to a vulnerable device. In this case, Apple hasn’t yet issued a public statement on the problem, but according to Cluley, the latest beta version of iOS fixes the issue. “[This] already incorporates a fix for the problem – so we may only be days away from having it pushed out to our vulnerable devices,” he wrote. “In the meantime, if you are worried or think you might be targeted by a mischief-maker who delights in crashing your device, you might be wise to disable message previews on your iPhone.” Android users can meanwhile log this one as a win in the mobile device wars: Google’s OS is unaffected. The news comes as Apple pushes back against claims that two zero-day bugs in its iPhone iOS have been exploited for years. A widely disseminated report published Wednesday by ZecOps claimed that bugs in the Apple Mail app on iPhones and have been exploited in the wild since 2018 by an “advanced threat operator.” However, Apple said in a statement to Bloomberg’s Apple correspondent Mark Gurman that he posted on Twitter that the findings aren’t true.

"Black market machine trading has gone beyond the sale of servers and now includes PCs located on corporate networks or that contain sensitive data. LAS VEGAS — Black market machine trading of PC and server resources is maturing at alarming speeds. Underground networks such as xDedic have fine-tuned their compute platform to the point where they are almost indistinguishable to legitimate networks such as Amazon Web Services and Rackspace. Those observations come from Israel Barak, head of incident response at Cybereason who will be explaiing his research at Black Hat USA 2016 on Wednesday when he will discuss buyers and sellers are connecting on markets such as xDedic and growing new cyber criminal market opportunities. XDedic is one of many platforms for the sale of compromised RDP servers that Cybereason now says has branched out and is selling access to compromised PCs. “Unsophisticated click-fraud hackers that have made their living infecting PCs with malware are waking up to realize that all those PCs they have infected can be sold as resources,” Barak said. Cybereason said far more sophisticated cybercriminals are luring these less sophisticated malware peddlers with attractive new ways of turning infected PCs into to profits. The right infected PC inside the right company with desirable point-of-sale software running on it, for example, can fetch as much as $1,000 per computer. A less desirable consumer PC still might go for $10 a pop. Selling access to compromised servers isn’t new, but selling access to PCs is, Barak said. “Multiple cybercrime organizations have diversified their business by selling compromised machines or compromised corporate assets on black market platforms,” he said. Cyber criminals aren’t attracted by a PC’s processing power. Rather, crooks are after access to a specific company where the PC resides. They view the PC as a springboard to go deeper into a corporate network or to just simply spend a week collecting credit card transaction data. At any given time on the xDedic platform, he said, criminals can pay an enrollment fee of $50 and start using the platform’s search engine to find a desirable PC that meets their criminal needs. Looking for a PC within a specific Fortune 500 company? No problem, according to Cybereason. Criminals can search for PCs by software, industry niche, bandwidth and processing capabilities as well searching for desirable geographies. The security firm estimates that there are more than 100,000 PCs now available for sale individually or via bulk sales. It reports there are nearly a dozen such platforms, such as xDedic, that cumulatively are earning between $150,000 and $250,000 a day. It estimates that 30 percent of compromised PCs for sale on the black market are located within the U.S. The marketplaces have evolved to have their own escrow services, similar to Ebay. They have their own sets of tools for optimizing compromised machines so they are more attractive to buyers. Part of that includes a host of custom tools for optimizing remote access and going undetected. “The key is to ensure reliable and stealthy remote access to make sure the asset can be easily transferred to the buyer,” Barak said. PCs have been scoffed at by cyber criminals as limited low-powered tools only good for conducting DDoS attacks or distributing spam, Barak said. But as the platform operators have become experts in the ability to identify where PC assets reside, what software is running on them and if they are located within desirable industries, attitudes have changed. “Crooks selling time on hijacked PCs for DDoS attacks and Bitcoin mining used to sell batches of a 1,000 PCs for $200 a day. By linking up with a platform such as xDedic they can sell each machine for $10 to $1,000,” Barak said. Platform operators who are acting like middlemen between buyers and sellers, Barak said, are fueling the economy and the number of new PCs coming online every day. “People think of adware and click-fraud as a stupid type of threat,” Barak said.

"Agency warns attackers targeting teleworkers to steal corporate data. The U.S. National Security Agency is offering advice to security teams looking for wireless best practices to protect corporate networks and personal devices. The recommendations, while pedestrian in scope, do offer system administrators a solid cheat sheet to share with their work-from-home crowd and mobile workforces. For starters the NSA, in a public service announcement posted on Thursday (PDF), urged security teams to be mindful of the wireless threats employees face when using Wi-Fi networks. It also lumps Bluetooth technology and Near Field Communications (NFC) into its list of worrisome protocols. By now, café-based workers have likely mastered both public bathroom and Wi-Fi hotspot hygiene. But, for anyone who hasn’t the NSA advises: “Data sent over public Wi-Fi—especially open public Wi-Fi that does not require a password to access— is vulnerable to theft or manipulation.” Advice also includes warnings of fake access points that can vacuum up user credentials and skim other personal data retrieved on the “evil twin” access points. NSA Warns of Bluetooth More interestingly, the agency cites Bluetooth as a convenient protocol for private use, but when used in public settings it can be a nasty security liability. The NSA advises turning off Bluetooth in public, lest a user be open to a range of attacks such as BlueBorne or BlueBugging – both used to access and exfiltrate corporate data on targeted devices. Just last May, security researcher Fabian Braunlein with Positive Security identified Apple’s Send My Bluetooth exploit which allowed data to be exfiltrated from a device to an attacker-controlled Apple iCloud server. Worrisome NFC The NSA also touched on Near Field Communications (NFC), a handy tool for contactless payments. It said data transfer between devices using NFC can be a cybersecurity minefield of pitfalls. With just a tap data, is moved across a radio network from one device to another. Andy Norton a cyber-risk officer with Armis told Threatpost security teams are lagging behind when it comes to securing NFC communications. “Radio connected devices represents a huge risk blind spot for organizations,” Norton said. “These are very much the soft underbelly of information security controls –– the majority of energy, focus, and money from a cyber resilience perspective is spent on preventing attacks coming through the internet connected attack surface. Very little is being done to access the risk from near field radio connections.” He added on just about every job his team finds a “rogue antenna device and shadow IT activity from antenna-enabled IoT devices.” In its security bulletin, the NSA suggests: Disable NFC feature when not needed (if possible). Do not bring devices near other unknown electronic devices. (This can trigger automatic communication.) Do not use NFC to communicate passwords or sensitive data. “Users should consider additional security measures, including limiting/disabling device location features, using strong device passwords, and only using trusted device accessories, such as original charging cords,” said the NSA. User Behavior Biggest Cybersecurity Challenge The NSA’s wireless warnings, while basic, still go unheeded by too many. Sadly, the practical and basic advice still needs promoted, experts said. “My fear is that the don’ts are ingrained, existing behaviors that are not easy to change and at times unavoidable,” Setu Kulkarni with NTT Application Security said. “For example, while it is easy to say ‘Do not bring devices near other unknown electronic devices,’ is that practical?” Kulkarni added in an ideal world one key employee cybersecurity rule companies should have in place is keeping personal stuff of their business devices. Enforcing compliance gets much trickier. “These tips are as relevant in 2021 as they were in 2015, but with the shift to more remote work, there are more people using public Wi-Fi,” said Tim Erlin with Tripwire. “While these tips are useful, it can be hard for the average user to understand how to implement them.

The U.S. National Security Agency is offering advice to security teams looking for wireless best practices to protect corporate networks and personal devices. The recommendations, while pedestrian in scope, do offer system administrators a solid cheat sheet to share with their work-from-home crowd and mobile workforces. For starters the NSA, in a public service announcement posted on Thursday (PDF), urged security teams to be mindful of the wireless threats employees face when using Wi-Fi networks. It also lumps Bluetooth technology and Near Field Communications (NFC) into its list of worrisome protocols. By now, café-based workers have likely mastered both public bathroom and Wi-Fi hotspot hygiene. But, for anyone who hasn’t the NSA advises: “Data sent over public Wi-Fi—especially open public Wi-Fi that does not require a password to access— is vulnerable to theft or manipulation.” Advice also includes warnings of fake access points that can vacuum up user credentials and skim other personal data retrieved on the “evil twin” access points. NSA Warns of Bluetooth More interestingly, the agency cites Bluetooth as a convenient protocol for private use, but when used in public settings it can be a nasty security liability. The NSA advises turning off Bluetooth in public, lest a user be open to a range of attacks such as BlueBorne or BlueBugging – both used to access and exfiltrate corporate data on targeted devices. Just last May, security researcher Fabian Braunlein with Positive Security identified Apple’s Send My Bluetooth exploit which allowed data to be exfiltrated from a device to an attacker-controlled Apple iCloud server.

"Researchers warn of a spike in the cryptocurrency-mining botnet since August 2020. Researchers are warning of a recent dramatic uptick in the activity of the Lemon Duck cryptocurrency-mining botnet, which targets victims’ computer resources to mine the Monero virtual currency. Click to Register! Researchers warn that Lemon Duck is “one of the more complex” mining botnets, with several interesting tricks up its sleeve. While the botnet has been active since at least the end of December 2018, researchers observed an increase in DNS requests connected with its command-and-control (C2) and mining servers since the end of August, in a slew of attacks centered on Asia (including ones targeting Iran, Egypt, Philippines, Vietnam and India). “Cisco Talos has identified activity in our endpoint telemetry associated with Lemon Duck cryptocurrency mining malware, affecting three different companies in the government, retail, and technology sectors,” said researchers with Cisco Talos, in Tuesday research. “We observed the activity spanning from late March 2020 to present.” More recent attacks have included less-documented modules that are loaded by the main PowerShell component – including a Linux branch and a module allowing further spread by sending emails to victims with COVID-19 lures. Threatpost has reached out to researchers for further information about how many victims have been targeted and the extent to which the botnet’s operators have profited off of the cryptomining attacks. Lemon Duck Lemon Duck has at least 12 independent infection vectors – more than most malware. These capabilities range from  Server Message Block (SMB) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) password brute-forcing, sending emails with exploit attachments or targeting the RDP BlueKeep flaw (CVE-2019-0708) in Windows machines; or targeting vulnerabilities in Redis (an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache and message broker) and YARN Hadoop (a resource-management and job-scheduling technology) in Linux machines. Lemon Duck botnet August activity. Credit: Cisco Talos After the initial infection, a PowerShell loading script is downloaded, which utilizes the function “bpu” to disable Windows Defender real-time detection and put powershell.exe on the list of processes excluded from scanning. “bpu” also checks if the script is running with administrative privileges. If it is, the payload is downloaded and run using the Invoke-Expression cmdlet (a function that can be utilized for calling code within a script or building commands to be executed later). If not, it leverages existing system executables to launch the next stage. “This is a good starting point for analysis and retrieval of additional modules,” said researchers. “Almost all PowerShell modules are obfuscated with four or five layers of obfuscation, likely generated by the Invoke-Obfuscation module. Although they are relatively easy to remove, they still slow down the analysis process and make detection using regular signatures more difficult.” These executable modules, which are downloaded and driven by the main module, communicates with the C2 server over HTTP. Modular Functionalities The modules include a main loader, which checks the level of user privileges and components relevant for mining, such as the type of the available graphic card (including GTX, Nvidia, GeForce, AMD and Radeon). If these GPUs are not detected, the loader downloads and runs the commodity XMRig CPU-based mining script. Other modules include a main spreading module (with what researchers say include “a rather ambitious piece of code” containing more than 10,000 lines of coding), a Python-based module packaged using Pyinstaller, and a killer module designed to disable known competing mining botnets. Lemon Duck also includes an email-spreading module. These spread emails using a mix of COVID-19-related subject lines and text, as well as other emotion-driven lures (such as an email subject “WTF” with the text “What’s wrong with you?are you out of your mind!!!!!!!”). These emails contain an infected attachments sent using Outlook automation to every contact in the affected user’s address book. An example of an email sent by the Lemon Duck module. Credit: Cisco Talos Linux Branch Researchers also shed light on a less documented Linux branch of the Lemon Duck malware. These Lemon Duck bash scripts are executed after the attacker successful compromises a Linux host (via Redis, YARN or SSH). There are two main bash scripts, said researchers: The first collects some data about the infected host and attempts to download a Linux version of the XMRig miner, before attempting to delete various system logs. The second attempts to terminate and remove competing cryptocurrency miners already present on the system. “The script also attempts to terminate and uninstall processes related to Alibaba and Tencent cloud security agents. The script seems to be shared between several Linux-based cryptomining botnets,” said researchers. Lemon Duck was previously spotted in 2020 in a campaign targeting printers, smart TVs and automated guided vehicles that depend on Windows 7. Researchers in February warned that the processor-intensive mining efforts are taking their toll on gear and triggering equipment malfunctions along with exposing devices to safety issues, disruption of supply chains and data loss. Defenders can stomp out the threat of cryptocurrency attacks by monitoring system behavior to spot any resource-sucking threats. “Cryptocurrency-mining botnets can be costly in terms of the stolen computing cycles and power consumption costs,” they said. “While organizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets, they should not ignore threats that are not particularly targeted toward their infrastructure.”  On October 14 at 2 PM ET Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Researchers warn of a spike in the cryptocurrency-mining botnet since August 2020.

"Researchers warn of critical flaws in SAP’s Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise software. Researchers are urging users to apply patches for several critical vulnerabilities in SAP’s Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). If exploited, the most severe flaws could give unprivileged users complete control of databases and – in some cases – even underlying operating systems. ASE (previously known as Sybase SQL server) is SAP’s popular database management software, targeted for transactional-based applications. ASE is used by more than 30,000 organizations globally – including 90 percent of the top banks and security firms worldwide, according to SAP.  Researchers disclosed six vulnerabilities that they discovered while conducting security tests for the latest version of the software, ASE 16 (SP03 PL08). While SAP has released patches for both ASE 15.7 and 16.0 in its May 2020 update, researchers disclosed technical details of the flaws on Wednesday, saying “there is no question” that the patches should be applied immediately if they haven’t been already. “For the last several years there have been relatively few security patches for SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE),” said Trustwave researchers in a Wednesday analysis. “New security research conducted by Trustwave revealed a bunch of vulnerabilities in the current version of SAP’s flagship relational database product. Historically, SAP ASE is widely used by the financial sector in the US and other countries.” The most severe vulnerability, CVE-2020-6248, has a CVSS score of 9.1 out of 10. The flaw stems from a lack of security checks for overwriting critical configuration files during database backup operations. That means any unprivileged user who can run a DUMP command (used by database owners to back up the file system to storage devices) can send a corrupted configuration file, resulting in potential takeover of the database. This file will then be detected by the server and replaced with a default configuration – which allows anyone to connect to the Backup Server using the login and an empty password. “The next step would be to change the sybmultbuf_binary Backup Server setting to point to an executable of the attacker’s choice,” said researchers. “Subsequent DUMP commands will now trigger the execution of the attacker’s executable. If SAP ASE is running on Windows, the code will run as LocalSystem by default.” Another critical flaw (CVE-2020-6252) was discovered affecting Windows installations of the SAP ASE 16. That bug exists in a small helper database (SQL Anywhere) used by the SAP ASE installation to manage database creation and version management. Specifically, the issue is in the Cockpit component of ASE, which is a web-based tool for monitoring the status and availability of SAP ASE servers. The issues stems from the password, used to login in to the helper database, being in a configuration file that is readable by any Windows user. “This means any valid Windows user can grab the file and recover the password to login to the helper SQL Anywhere database as the special user utility_db and then issue commands like CREATE ENCRYPTED FILE to overwrite operating system files (remember, the helper database runs as LocalSystem by default!) and possibly cause code execution with LocalSystem privileges,” said researchers. In another issue, researchers found clear text passwords in the ASE server installation logs: “The logs are only readable to the SAP account, but will completely compromise the SAP ASE when joined with some other issue that allows filesystem access,” they said. Researchers also found two SQL injection flaws that could be abused to allow privilege escalation. One (CVE-2020-6241) exists in global temporary tables in ASE 16, while the other (CVE-2020-6253) stems from the WebServices handling code of ASE. The final bug discovered was an XP Server flaw (CVE-2020-6243) that could allow authenticated Windows users to gain arbitrary code execution (as LocalSystem) if they can connect to the SAP ASE. “Organizations often store their most critical data in databases, which, in turn, are often necessarily exposed in untrusted or publicly exposed environments,” said researchers. “This makes vulnerabilities like these essential to address and test quickly since they not only threaten the data in the database but potentially the full host that it is running on.” Concerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

"WordPress silently fixed a serious content injection vulnerability when it pushed out its latest security release, 4.7.2, last week WordPress silently fixed a serious content injection vulnerability when it pushed out its latest security release, 4.7.2, last week. Sucuri, the firm that found the vulnerability, disclosed it Wednesday and said that if exploited, it could have let an attacker modify the content of any WordPress post or page. A WordPress core maintainer said the company delayed disclosing the vulnerability, technically an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability that existed in a REST API endpoint, to “ensure the safety of millions of additional WordPress sites.” WordPress introduced REST API endpoints by default to the CMS when it pushed version 4.7 in early December 2016 to allow access to WordPress posts, comments, terms, and other settings Marc-Alexandre Montpas, a security researcher with Sucuri found the flaw and alerted WordPress on Jan. 20. Aaron Campbell, a WordPress core maintainer, helped breakdown the timeline around the vulnerability and the steps WordPress took to remedy it, on Wednesday. According to Campbell, WordPress’ security team had a fix implemented fairly quickly; it just needed to be tested. The team spent the weekend coordinating with companies, such as Sucuri, that deploy web application firewalls to block exploits against their customers. WordPress said it also reached out to Incapsula, Cloudflare, and SiteLock to ensure their customers had rules in place to thwart any exploits. After WordPress gathered data from the companies, it was assured the exploit hadn’t been exploited in the wild. “On Monday, while we continued to test and refine the fix, our focus shifted to WordPress hosts. We contacted them privately with information on the vulnerability and ways to protect users,” Campbell wrote, “Hosts worked closely with the security team to implement protections and regularly checked for exploit attempts against their users.” WordPress elected to put off disclosing the vulnerability to make sure that its users – the bulk of which have automatic updates installed on their sites – were protected before going public on Wednesday with the details. According to Montpas, who described the vulnerability in detail Wednesday, the issue stemmed from the way the REST API managed access. Specifically it favored values such as $_GET and $_POST over the usual routes. That made it so if an attacker wanted to, they could have sent a request that contained letters in its ID. Another issue with the endpoint made it so if a request didn’t specify a post, it could still bypass a permission check in place and continue executing. Montpas said that WordPress, at least until last week, “casts the ID parameter to an integer before passing it to get_post.” If an attacker had submitted an alphanumerical request, the post would have been translated so it was strictly numbers. From there they could’ve changed the content on a page, exploited further vulnerabilities and even exploited code, he writes. “From there, they can add plugin-specific shortcodes to exploit vulnerabilities (that would otherwise be restricted to contributor roles), infect the site content with an SEO spam campaign, or inject ads, etc,” Montpas writes, “Depending on the plugins enabled on the site, even PHP code could be executed very easily.” The rest of WordPress’ 4.7.2 update last week was fairly low-key. In addition to the silently fixed content injection vulnerability, the update fixed several cross-site scripting bugs, a SQL injection vulnerability, and an issue with permissions. : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] WordPress silently fixed a serious content injection vulnerability when it pushed out its latest security release, 4.7.2, last week WordPress silently fixed a serious content injection vulnerability when it pushed out its latest security release, 4.7.2, last week.

According to Montpas, who described the vulnerability in detail Wednesday, the issue stemmed from the way the REST API managed access. Specifically it favored values such as $_GET and $_POST over the usual routes. That made it so if an attacker wanted to, they could have sent a request that contained letters in its ID. Another issue with the endpoint made it so if a request didn’t specify a post, it could still bypass a permission check in place and continue executing. Montpas said that WordPress, at least until last week, “casts the ID parameter to an integer before passing it to get_post.” If an attacker had submitted an alphanumerical request, the post would have been translated so it was strictly numbers. From there they could’ve changed the content on a page, exploited further vulnerabilities and even exploited code, he writes. “From there, they can add plugin-specific shortcodes to exploit vulnerabilities (that would otherwise be restricted to contributor roles), infect the site content with an SEO spam campaign, or inject ads, etc,” Montpas writes, “Depending on the plugins enabled on the site, even PHP code could be executed very easily.” The rest of WordPress’ 4.7.2 update last week was fairly low-key. In addition to the silently fixed content injection vulnerability, the update fixed several cross-site scripting bugs, a SQL injection vulnerability, and an issue with permissions. : Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"
"Oracle fixed a record 276 vulnerabilities – more than half of which are remotely exploitable – as part of its July Critical Patch Update on Tuesday afternoon. Oracle has one-upped itself once again. The company fixed a record 276 vulnerabilities – more than half of which are remotely exploitable – as part of its July Critical Patch Update released Tuesday afternoon. The quarterly patch update resolves vulnerabilities in 84 different products, including Oracle Database Server, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and Oracle’s E-Business Suite to name a few. The number of fixes exceeds the previous all time high, 248 patches, pushed by Oracle in January and marks more than double the amount of vulnerabilities addressed by the company in its last CPU in April. Like the April CPU, more than 50 percent of the vulnerabilities, 159 in total, can be exploited remotely without authentication. Oracle Fusion Middleware is the biggest culprit; 35 of the 40 vulnerabilities that affect the software are remotely exploitable. The company’s E-Business Suite – in which 21 of the 23 vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable – and Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite – in which 21 of the 34 vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable – also merit attention. Nineteen vulnerabilities across nine different products fetch a CVSS 3.0 rating of 9.8, the most critical vulnerability rating this quarter. While Oracle is encouraging its customers to apply the fixes as soon as possible, users will want to prioritize the update if they’re running one of the nine affected pieces of software: Oracle Fusion Middleware, Supply Chain Products, Oracle Communications Applications, Oracle Health Sciences, Oracle Retail Applications, Oracle Sun Systems Products Suite, and Oracle Virtualization. All 19 bugs are remotely exploitable without authentication, meaning an attacker wouldn’t need a username or password to exploit them, according to Oracle’s advisory. It wouldn’t be an Oracle CPU without patches for perennial whipping boy Java. This quarter’s update includes 13 patches for Java SE, nine of which are remotely exploitable without authentication. Users running Java SE version(s) 6u115, 7u101, 8u92, or Java SE Embedded, version(s) 8u92, are affected. Noted researcher David Litchfield, a skilled Oracle bug hunter, uncovered nearly 10 percent of the vulnerabilities, 27 bugs, including a mix of SQL injections, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and server-side request forgery attacks. Litchfield outlined the bugs via .PDF documents on Tuesday. Among them were a slew of XSS flaws in Oracle Primavera, project management software that’s usually used in industries such as engineering, construction, aerospace and other fields. Litchfield discovered that via arbitrary HTML/script that doesn’t use parentheses or a .write clause an attacker could bypass a XSS filter designed to protect users against exploitation in the software. One of the scariest sounding vulnerabilities he found exists in Agile, Oracle’s Product Lifecycle Management Database. The vulnerability could allow a user Index Privileges on SYS tables, something that could allow them to execute as SYS and allow “complete compromise of the database.” Litchfield also described a series of SQL injections in eBusiness Suite, a XSS and SSRF flaw in Apex, and XSS vulnerabilities in Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition. Considering the sheer number of vulnerabilities, experts on Tuesday said it’s likely admins will have their plates full with this quarter’s patches. “Oracle systems are complex and multi-component, not speaking about numerous customizations every company usually has,”Alexander Polyakov, CTO at ERPScan, a company that helps companies secure Oracle enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, “So, Oracle admins should be ready for difficult and time-consuming work of implementing all the patches.” : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing","<s>[INST] Oracle fixed a record 276 vulnerabilities – more than half of which are remotely exploitable – as part of its July Critical Patch Update on Tuesday afternoon.

"Threat hunters weigh in on how the business of ransomware, the complex relationships between cybercriminals, and how they work together and hawk their wares on the Dark Web. Ransomware is not just a type of malware \u2013 it\u2019s also at the center of a sophisticated, flourishing underground economy that has all the conventions of legitimate commerce. It\u2019s a community made up of major malware developers, affiliates and channel partners, and those that provide adjacent services, such as selling network access.

"Matan Or-El, co-founder and CEO at Panorays Third-party breaches have become an epidemic as cybercriminals target the weakest link. Organizations such as BestBuy, Sears, Delta and even NYU Medical Center are just a few that have felt the impact of cyberattacks through third-party vendors. The fallout from these breaches can be costly, as the average enterprise pays $1.23 million per incident, up 24 percent from $992,000 in 2017 according to Kaspersky Lab. The same report also notes that SMBs spend $120,000; an increase of 36 percent from last year. With a spike in cyberattacks directly targeting supply chains across the globe, the problem stems from several issues: all of them involve some type of necessary sharing, from shared credentials to shared infrastructure. Weakest Link No. 1: Shared Credentials Look no further than the Target breach to see how terribly things can go wrong when businesses share their credentials with third-party vendors, especially with companies that seem benign: Target’s breach was reportedly through an air conditioning vendor. When a company shares sensitive credentials with a supplier, the door is left wide open to potential attacks. It should also be noted that most companies–even smaller ones–work with anywhere from several to thousands of vendors, increasing the risk exponentially. This situation dictates that companies must ensure that a rigorous vetting process is put in place before sharing credentials. Weakest Link No. 2: Shared Data Shared data can be another key weakness. Companies share highly sensitive and private content with vendors, including customer data, which is unavoidable. These vendors may also share data with many more whose cyber security posture is not known. Case in point: The Experian breach ended up exposing millions of Americans’ personal data, but it also exposed 15 million customers’ data who applied for the T-Mobile service. While Experian was the primary target, T-Mobile suffered a huge loss as well. Weakest Link No. 3: Shared Code or Applications Ticketmaster made this mistake with Inbenta Technologies, a third-party supplier hosting a Ticketmaster customer support product. As part of this process, Ticketmaster received customized JavaScript code, which a hacker gained access to through Inbenta and then modified the code to be malicious. Every single piece of code or application that a company shares with a supplier means exposure to another potential attack. Weak Link No. 4: Shared Network Connecting with other companies can be a boon for business, but this particular type of collaboration is also rife with risk. Imagine a scenario in which WannaCry ransomware is able to run rampant from company to company all around the world. For those IT teams that have no choice but to use these types of connections, it is absolutely essential to downsize the number of vendors that share a connection, create tighter permissions and monitor them on an ongoing basis. Weakest Link No. 5: Shared Infrastructure Problems with shared infrastructure can quickly cause a direct blow to businesses by halting continuity. For example, if the vendor supplying retail infrastructure suddenly drops or the service goes down, the company is instantly left without a way to handle transactions. And just like that, customers are forced to head to a competitor. Medical processing services are another example; the service goes down and, without warning, the doctors have a difficult time doing their jobs because their patient information is temporarily inaccessible, as we saw in a recent incident at MEDAntex. Mitigating Risks with Suppliers The first step in reducing security risks associated with third-party vendors is to hammer out a digital vendor risk management plan that includes rules, procedures and a rigorous vetting process. The vetting process has to go far beyond a mere questionnaire; it must also include the context and level of risk of business relationships. Automation is key for these processes so that companies are able to scale to manage hundreds and thousands of vendors on a daily basis. An outside reporting company should be employed to continuously monitor the cyber posture of any third-party vendor and ensure it’s on par with the security risk level that the evaluating organization accepts. There should also be a way to alert the evaluating organization of infractions, so that they can easily work with vendors to correct and improve their security posture. With these processes in place, the whole digital ecosystem could be improved significantly. (Matan Or-El is co-founder and CEO at Panorays, a firm that automates third party security management. He started Panorays with the goal of improving the industry’s cyber-resilience. Matan served in the Israeli Air Force as chief architect responsible for mission-critical defense systems. Later, he worked at Imperva leading the infrastructure for all of Imperva’s products portfolio.) : Breach InfoSec Insider Vulnerabilities",T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,"<s>[INST] Matan Or-El, co-founder and CEO at Panorays Third-party breaches have become an epidemic as cybercriminals target the weakest link. Organizations such as BestBuy, Sears, Delta and even NYU Medical Center are just a few that have felt the impact of cyberattacks through third-party vendors. The fallout from these breaches can be costly, as the average enterprise pays $1.23 million per incident, up 24 percent from $992,000 in 2017 according to Kaspersky Lab. The same report also notes that SMBs spend $120,000; an increase of 36 percent from last year. With a spike in cyberattacks directly targeting supply chains across the globe, the problem stems from several issues: all of them involve some type of necessary sharing, from shared credentials to shared infrastructure. Weakest Link No. 1: Shared Credentials Look no further than the Target breach to see how terribly things can go wrong when businesses share their credentials with third-party vendors, especially with companies that seem benign: Target’s breach was reportedly through an air conditioning vendor. When a company shares sensitive credentials with a supplier, the door is left wide open to potential attacks. It should also be noted that most companies–even smaller ones–work with anywhere from several to thousands of vendors, increasing the risk exponentially. This situation dictates that companies must ensure that a rigorous vetting process is put in place before sharing credentials. Weakest Link No. 2: Shared Data Shared data can be another key weakness. Companies share highly sensitive and private content with vendors, including customer data, which is unavoidable. These vendors may also share data with many more whose cyber security posture is not known. Case in point: The Experian breach ended up exposing millions of Americans’ personal data, but it also exposed 15 million customers’ data who applied for the T-Mobile service. While Experian was the primary target, T-Mobile suffered a huge loss as well. Weakest Link No. 3: Shared Code or Applications Ticketmaster made this mistake with Inbenta Technologies, a third-party supplier hosting a Ticketmaster customer support product. As part of this process, Ticketmaster received customized JavaScript code, which a hacker gained access to through Inbenta and then modified the code to be malicious. Every single piece of code or application that a company shares with a supplier means exposure to another potential attack. Weak Link No. 4: Shared Network Connecting with other companies can be a boon for business, but this particular type of collaboration is also rife with risk. Imagine a scenario in which WannaCry ransomware is able to run rampant from company to company all around the world. For those IT teams that have no choice but to use these types of connections, it is absolutely essential to downsize the number of vendors that share a connection, create tighter permissions and monitor them on an ongoing basis. Weakest Link No. 5: Shared Infrastructure Problems with shared infrastructure can quickly cause a direct blow to businesses by halting continuity. For example, if the vendor supplying retail infrastructure suddenly drops or the service goes down, the company is instantly left without a way to handle transactions. And just like that, customers are forced to head to a competitor.

"Security risk in extensible text editors enable hackers to abuse plugins and escalate privileges. Security risks in popular extensible text editors allow hackers to abuse plugins and escalate privileges on targeted systems, according to new research from SafeBreach. Inadequate separation of regular and elevated access modes used in editors and a lack of folder permissions integrity allow attackers to achieve execution of arbitrary code from regular user permissions. A Mar.15 report from SafeBreach details the research of Dor Azouri, who looked at five notable text editors that offer the benefits of extensibility. By loading plugins for Sublime, Vim, Emacs, Gedit, and pico/nano– the most popular editors with third-party plugins for the UNIX environments, Azouri successfully leveraged each text editor for privilege escalation through simulated attacks. Because application functionality is improved through extensions, it’s not uncommon for text editors to run third-party code. The benefits of performance and productivity have outweighed the risk. But loading plugins when folder permissions integrity is not well kept introduces security risks. Moreover, the attack methods proved successful with all files opened in the editor, even with common limitations applied on sudo commands. The attackers can target specific locations and plant their malicious extensions, altering the seemingly innocuous extensible text editors into another way to gain privilege escalation on the machine. Attackers who have gained access to user credentials through phishing scams or other nefarious means have the ability to write code even without elevated status. They can write a malicious plugin to the user folder of the editor that’s in use. Eventually–and particularly for users on Linux servers who commonly have to run text editors with elevated privileges– the editor will be invoked in elevated status. Then, the user enters his root password, the application is launched,and the malicious code is executed. While developers of 3rd party plugins have had malicious code executed (intentionally or unintentionally) as part of these plugins, there are no reports of malicious attacks abusing text editors for privilege escalation. Still, incidents involving abuse of extensibility are not unheard of. The SafeBreach report demonstrates privilege escalation details for each of the five text editors tested by AzoOSSECuri. Though aware of the security risk discovered by SafeBreach, the developers of the text editors don’t plan on making any changes. To mitigate the risks, SafeBreach recommends adding these rules to OSSEC syscheck configuration. Additionally, Azouri said one way to improve the integrity of the folder permissions is to entirely separate the plugins folders that are used when running the editors in elevated mode (using sudo). “In this solution, there will be one folder owned by the user where he can place his/her plugins, and one folder owned by root where all the approved plugins will reside. When the editor is invoked in an elevated mode, it will load the plugins from the root owned folder only. This way, modifying the plugins that are root owned will require entering the root password. The security risk and plausibility of this kind of attack is determined by parameters that differ in each organization. Risk is affected by the scale of use of UNIX systems in the network and the common tools the users are editing the files, among other parameters. Given that developers don’t plan to patch the vulnerability, Azouri suggested several defense measures for users. Deny write permissions for non-elevated users, by taking root ownership on the relevant plugins folder, (e.g. ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User) Monitor modifications to the key files and folders presented in this article Track changes and review them Review 3rd party plugins code before approving their use in the network environment, Use simpler editors that don’t expose powerful API to 3rd party plugins. Because similar extensibility models might be found in other kinds of software, Azouri said, “I suggest users and developers alike should apply these precautions on other extensible software that allow the loading of external modules, and not just text editors.” (This article was written by guest author Kacy Zurkus.

"The EFF is working on an open wireless router firmware that’s designed to be a secure and flexible alternative to the existing software that runs on home and small business routers, much of which is notoriously insecure. The Open Wireless Router project, which the organization announced at the HOPE X conference over the weekend, is in very early form at this point, but the EFF is hopeful that developers, hackers and security experts will lend their talents to the project and help improve it. The EFF has designed the firmware to help users share their networks with guests and co-workers while still providing a secured segment for themselves. “We are offering this hacker alpha release to engage enthusiastic technical users who would like to help us test, develop, improve, and harden the Open Wireless Router. Currently the software runs on one specific model of hardware (the Netgear WNDR3800) and is based on the CeroWRT project,” the EFF said in a blog post announcing the project. Among the features that the OpenWireless Router firmware includes are: Let you share a bounded portion of your bandwidth on the open network, so guest users cannot slow down your Internet connection or use a large portion of your monthly quota.2 Provide state-of-the-art network queuing, so most users can expect an improved Internet experience—especially with latency-sensitive applications—compared to what commonly available consumer grade routers are delivering today. One of the goals of the project is to provide better security than is available in most wireless router software. Cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities are quite common in wireless router firmware and attackers can exploit them to get access to the administrative functions of vulnerable routers. The Open Wireless Project includes some features to protect against XSS and CSRF attacks. “We require a CSRF token with all POST requests in order to prevent CSRF. The CSRF token is a hash of the auth token so the two are bound together to prevent cookie forcing attacks. Validation of CSRF tokens is done in constant time. We generate the auth token using os.urandom(), a secure random number generator. Both the auth token and the CSRF token are sent to the browser as cookies, and the secure flag is set if user login is via HTTPS. The HttpOnly flag is set on the auth cookie so that an attacker with a temporary XSS cannot steal it,” the security documentation for the software says.

"The increased proliferation of IoT devices paved the way for the rise of IoT botnets that amplifies DDoS attacks today. This is a dangerous warning that the possibility of a sophisticated DDoS attack and a prolonged service outage will prevent businesses from growing. While data breaches and ransomware are still considered among the more significant concern for businesses, the threats sometimes come from a direction we weren’t expecting. Cybercriminals use botnets for various malicious purposes, most significantly for DDoS attacks against targets. The most important change is now the bot armies are increasingly made of IoT devices. As the total installed base of IoT devices worldwide is expected to reach 30.9 billion by 2025, the IoT botnet threat and its overall power continue to expand. Attackers seized the opportunity to create large botnets, to large complex DDoS attacks to disable or knock offline a target website. Although the IoT botnets can steal confidential data, as seen in the instance of the Torri botnet, most of the botnets have been used for DDoS attacks. This is a dangerous warning for an online business to ensure they have effective anti-DDoS protection and bot takeover prevention. High-Level Anatomy of IoT DDoS Attack So, what is a botnet? – A botnet is a group of infected computers under the control of attackers used to perform various scams and cyber-attacks. Here, the attackers use malware to take control of vulnerable IoT devices to block legitimate users from accessing internet services by executing DDoS attacks. A simple principle governs a DDoS attack: it takes down websites offline by consuming more resources or occupying all available bandwidth. Attackers with more hijacked IoT devices can consume more resources and launch a more damaging attack. The three main goals of attackers include: To cause consumption of limited resources To cause destructive changes to network devices To change or destroy configuration information Why Are IoT Devices Easy Prey for Botnet Malware? The increased proliferation of IoT devices has become an attractive target for attackers. Further, most IoT devices include serious security issues like weak passwords, open access to management systems, default administrative credentials, or weak security configurations. As millions of IoT devices and their numbers continue to increase, they are not constantly updated to patch against security vulnerabilities. Botnet attacks seize the opportunity of IoT vulnerabilities to take control of the devices and lead to disruptions in online services. They’re most placed on networks that are not monitored for the attack, making it easy for attackers to access them. Further, in most cases, the network where they reside offers a high-speed connection that enables a large amount of DDoS attack traffic. Major IoT Botnet DDoS Attack Trends IoT botnet DDoS attacks are not new; Mirai was the most prevalent and has continued to target IoT devices since 2016. Mirai made its debut on September 20, 2016, with a DDoS attack against cybersecurity expert Krebs’s blog. The next notable IoT botnet DDoS attack was in October 2016 against Dyn, a major DNS (Domain Name Service). The Mirai botnet assaulted the victim with one terabit traffic per second, which made a new record in a DDoS attack. According to the ENISA threat landscape report, in 2019, the Mirai variants increased by 57%. The Verizon data breach investigations report recorded 103 699 botnet incidents primarily targeting professional, financial, and information services industry verticals. A new variant of Mirai called Mozi accounted for the most observed flooded traffic in late 2019 through 2020. The Mirai and its variant continue to pose a threat in 2021; they broadened their attack with its significant new capabilities. Attackers use multiple botnets based on Mirai and Mozi botnets like Echobot, BotenaGo, Moonet, and Loli to target devices. According to Sam’s report on the IoT security landscape, more than 1 billion IoT security attacks took place in 2021, nearly 62 million of which were IoT-related DDoS attacks. How Can You Protect Against IoT Botnet DDoS Attacks Today? As the botnet landscape expands and highly sophisticated threats become inevitable, enterprises must move beyond legacy security solutions. The first step to addressing these ongoing security challenges is moving to comprehensive risk-based security solutions. In addition, advanced, automated endpoint detection and protection solutions must offer complete visibility into IoT devices and their security state. As always, prevention steps should be implemented to stay protected from such attacks: Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic on your network for malicious activities with a web application firewall. Next-gen WAF like Indusface AppTrana can block bad bots from specific IPs while ensuring a smooth transfer of legitimate bot traffics. Monitor login attempts and create a lookout for spikes Keep IoT devices on protected networks Perform continuous security testing on IoT devices The Closure DDoS attacks are the standard intent of an IoT botnet.

"A few days after issuing a patch and reassuring owners that the attack that shut down the transmission and other systems remotely on a Jeep was not a huge risk, Fiat Chrysler has decided to recall nearly 1.5 million vehicles as a result of the bug exposed in the research. The recall is the result of research done by Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek that was released this week. The pair spent close to a year working on their project, which resulted in them identifying a vulnerability in the Uconnect computer included in some Fiat Chrysler cars sold in theUnited States. By exploiting the vulnerability, Miller and Valasek were able to move laterally to a separate chip and eventually issue remote commands to the vehicle to take over many of the Jeep’s systems. They were working on a Jeep that Miller owned. Fiat Chrysler issued a software update to fix the Uconnect issue a few days before the research was disclosed, but it is now recalling the affected vehicles, which include Jeep Cherokees, Grand Cherokees, Dodge Vipers, Dodge Challengers, and several other models. “The security of FCA US customers is a top priority, as is retaining their confidence in the Company’s products,” Fiat Chrysler said in a press release, according to CNBC. “Accordingly, FCA US has established a dedicated System Quality Engineering team focused on identifying and implementing best practices for software development and integration.” Earlier in the week, a company spokesman downplayed the risks of what Miller and Valasek disclosed. “To FCA’s knowledge, there has not been a single real world incident of an unlawful or unauthorized remote hack into any FCA vehicle,” Gualberto Ranieri, senior vice president of communications, said in a blog post. Valasek said on Twitter Friday that Fiat Chrysler seems to have closed off the attack avenue that he and Miller used to reach the Jeep remotely: the Sprint cellular network connection in the vehicles. “Looks like I can’t get to [Charlie’s] Jeep from my house via my phone. Good job FCA/Sprint!” Valasek said. Oddly, the timeline of the vulnerability and fixes provided by Fiat Chrysler to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration makes no mention of the research by Miller and Valasek, which they shared with the automaker throughout the research process. The timeline confirms that the communication port they used to connect to the remote vehicle has been closed by Sprint. “Additionally and more importantly, the cellular provider has remotely closed access to the open port on the radio. Successful single market testing was completed on July 22, 2015 with a nationwide rollout conducted on July 23, 2015. For this activity, no customer action is required and no services are interrupted. This action removes the known risk of long-range, remote hacking,” the timeline says. : Hacks Mobile Security Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services","<s>[INST] A few days after issuing a patch and reassuring owners that the attack that shut down the transmission and other systems remotely on a Jeep was not a huge risk, Fiat Chrysler has decided to recall nearly 1.5 million vehicles as a result of the bug exposed in the research.

Now Cisco Talos researchers are hoping to shed new light into the ongoing development of the potent EK in hopes of neutralizing the RIG EK threat. As with the unraveling of any EK, one of the keys to stopping infection rates is determining infection routes and how adversaries bypass security software and device. In a deep analysis of RIG, Cisco Talos team outlined recently the unique nature of the exploit kit. In a nutshell, like other exploit kits the crew behind RIG are using gates to redirect their victims to their exploit kit. But what makes RIG unique, according Cisco Talos researchers is the way RIG combines different web technologies, such as DoSWF, JavaScript, Flash and VBscript to obfuscate the attack. Making matters worse, each separate attack strategy utilizes “dynamically changing encoding and encryption for all files transmitted. Talos dissection of RIG also reveals this technique ensures scripts look different every time an attack session is launched. This, Cisco Talos said “ensures (attackers) can’t be detected by simple string matches or hash values.” At the heart of the RIG attack, researchers say, is a three-pronged attack strategy that leverages either a JavaScript, Flash, VBscript-based attacks as needed. With RIG, when it comes to the delivery of malware files, “the same malware file often gets written and executed multiple times on the victim’s PC. If one method doesn’t work or is blocked by an anti-malware solution, they have a couple of backup methods. All stages and methods are obfuscated, some more, some less,” Cisco Talos wrote. As part of its RIG campaign analysis Cisco Talos noted that most infections were initiated through compromised websites. “These are websites which were hacked and then the adversaries added malicious code into the website which redirected the user to the gate. The gate then redirects the user to the EK landing page,” according to Holger Unterbrink, the author of the blog. To a lesser extent, Unterbrink said, other RIG campaigns used gates which were using malvertising techniques, redirecting traffic to the adversary’s infection chain. Here victims are funneled into either a JavaScript, Flash, VBscript-based attack. In the end, all of these scripts are downloading and execute the same malware file which the exploit kit wants to install on the victim’s machine. Stage one of the attack is driving traffic to a compromised website which starts the redirection chain. The compromised website loads a malicious Flash (SWF) file. Next, that Flash file inserts one or two iFrames into the compromised site. Now, the victim’s browser is redirected via the iFrame to the gate. “The gate – which is nothing else than another web site on another server – does some checks and redirects the user again, but now to the exploit kit landing page – again another web page on another server,” Unterbrink said. Lastly, the exploit kit landing page includes three JavaScript variables – a JavaScript which loads a Flash (SWF) exploit, a VBscript with an exploit, and a third JavaScript that also contains an exploit. “This is a very complex infection chain with all of these steps using their own obfuscation techniques,” Unterbrink said. The SWF file is heavily obfuscated by commercial protection software called DoSWF, a professional Flash SWF encryptor. This Flash file itself, creates two malicious iFrames, according to Talos, that are served up inside a malicious website. One is generated instantly, the other is generated and placed into the compromise website a bit later after a timer in the first Flash file times out. Unterbrink says the reason for the timed delay is unclear, but theorizes it could be as a backup mechanism if the first compromise fails. Next, depending on vulnerabilities in the victim’s browser, either iFrame, both filled with JavaScript code, redirects the victim to the RIG exploit kits landing page. Here the victim’s browser is faced with three embedded scripts hidden inside corresponding JavaScript variables. One of the scripts hidden inside the RIG EK landing page is a VBscript. “After a couple of tests on the target system, (the VBscript) executes the DoMagic() function, which downloads the main malware payload of the campaign such as ransomware using the URL stored in the script,” according to Talos. A second script is also present on the RIG EK landing page that has the capability of inserts random comments such as “/*sw7586sdd*/” in between the JavaScript code used, Talos notes. “These comments are changed per session, which means that the Base64 encoded blob looks different in every session,” Talos researcher wrote in a technical write up outlining their research. This script then executes another malicious Flash (SWF) file that is once again obfuscated by the DoSWF Flash tool. Talos says it is working on de-obfuscating the code, but for now asserts the code “seems to be a type of shellcode payload which gets decoded at runtime, combined with other strings stored in the SWF, and finally executed by an exploit.” The remaining JavaScript file in the RIG exploit kit landing page, according to Talos, is exploiting CVE-2013-2551 (aka MS13-037) to download and infect the victim. MS13-037 is a vulnerability that exploits an integer overflow vulnerability on Internet Explorer, according to a Microsoft security bulletin from May 2013. “The vulnerability exists in the handling of the dashstyle.array length for vml shapes on the vgx.dll module. The exploit has been built and tested specifically against Windows 7 SP1 with Internet Explorer 8,” according to a technical description of MS13-037 by Rapid7. According to Talos, MS13-037 includes code that drives the victim to a URL to download the final EK malware. In the campaigns tracked by Cisco Talos for this report, it said payloads included ransomware (mainly CRYPTFILE2 and including Locky and CryptXXX), Trojans (Gamarue and Gootkit) and some broken executables, Unterbrink said. Protecting against RIG disabling all unnecessary browser plugins, recommends Cisco Talos. “Patching and updating is mandatory for all browsers and their plugins. Any browser with an unpatched outdated Flash plugin will get infected, it is just a question of time,” Unterbrink said. That time horizon, he said will be small. “I would guess something from minutes to a few days, depending on your luck and surfing behavior.” : Cryptography Hacks Malware Privacy Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter ,T1055 Process Injection ,T1082 System Information Discovery ,T1021 Remote Services ,T1018 Remote System Discovery ,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information ,T1562 Impair Defenses ","<s>[INST] In a deep analysis of RIG, Cisco Talos team outlined the way the exploit kit combines different web technologies such as DoSWF, JavaScript, Flash and VBscript to obfuscate attacks.

"DUBAI–When new technologies or platforms emerge, they tend to follow a familiar trajectory in terms of security. The evolution typically goes through something like the following stages: Hey, look what we built; huh, no, we didn’t think about that problem; we’re very serious about security; ok, now we’re actually serious about security. This is the path that virtually all platforms have followed, including the Internet itself, the commercial Web and, more recently, mobile systems. The amount of time that the full evolution takes has sped up greatly over the years, moving from the decades that it took with the Internet to a decade and a half or so with the Web to a few years with smartphones. This time compression has much to do with the acceleration of technology itself, but it also is dependent upon the amount and quality of attention that each platform has received from the security research community. As more and better researchers take an interest in a given platform, say iOS or Android, more issues are revealed, leading (hopefully) to improvements and hardening. While this evolution continues for all of the above platforms, a new–or rather, quite old–one is beginning to draw the attention of researchers: satellite communications. Satellites predate any of the other common communications platforms we use today, save landlines, but for much of their existence, they have been the province of governments and their contractors. The inner workings of these systems were known to a relatively small number of people, and that’s the way the manufacturers and operators liked it. Security through obscurity worked in their favor for decades. But the recent democratization of the technology has led to an increase in the number of small, private operators, and, perhaps more importantly, the availability of technical specifications, firmware and other tools that have enabled researchers to take a serious look at the security of these systems. At first blush, what they’ve found is neither surprising nor especially encouraging. At first blush, what they’ve found is neither surprising nor especially encouraging. Ruben Santamarta of IOActive last month published a paper that detailed his findings after reverse engineering the firmware of a number of commercial satellite terminals from a variety of vendors. And that was without having access to the physical terminals themselves; he only looked at the firmware. “IOActive found that malicious actors could abuse all of the devices within the scope of this study. The vulnerabilities included what would appear to be backdoors, hardcoded credentials, undocumented and/or insecure protocols, and weak encryption algorithms. In addition to design flaws, IOActive also uncovered a number of features in the devices that clearly pose security risks,” he wrote in the paper. “The current status of the products IOActive analyzed makes it almost impossible to guarantee the integrity of thousands of SATCOM devices. Appropriate action to mitigate these vulnerabilities should be taken.” Santamarta and IOActive reported the flaws through the CERT CC, but said that only one vendor, Iridium, responded. For anyone who has written or read a security advisory in the last 20 years, that response will come as no surprise. This is the same cycle that traditional software vendors, mobile platform makers, and most recently, SCADA vendors, have been going through. Some respond well, some don’t. There is some good news, however. Despite the lack of public acknowledgment and attention for Santamarta’s paper, satellite manufacturers and operators are quickly realizing the serious risk that such security problems pose to their businesses. At the World Space Risk Forum here this week, executives from large insurers, manufacturers and operators gathered to discuss the major issues they’re facing and cyber risk in general, and Santamarta’s paper specifically, were a major topic of conversation. Many of the insurance executives I spoke with during the week are in the process of rapidly getting up to speed on cybersecurity threats and risks and are trying to get a handle on exactly how big the problem is. Right now, the risks to these systems from cyber attacks is probably relatively low. Many of the attacks that Santamarta identified require physical access to a terminal, which is a hurdle in many cases. And attacking the ground stations that operate the satellites presents another set of challenges, but neither one is impossible. Nor is attacking the other link in the chain: the people. A poll of the audience during the session on cybersecurity risk identified people as the biggest vulnerability right now. That may be the case for now, but it won’t be for long if other researchers begin to build on the work of Santamarta and others who have come before him in this field. This has been the pattern for decades now as each new platform takes its turn in the spotlight. While satellites are anything but new, security research on the platforms is in its early stages. But with Santamarta’s paper as a road map, expect others to follow suit quickly. The sentiment I got from the assembled executives here was that they realize cybersecurity represents a major potential problem for them, and they’re trying to acquire as much talent and knowledge as they can right now to address it. Let’s hope they’ve learned from the mistakes of others in the past and meet the challenge head-on.

"Ransomware actors behind the attack have breached at least 85,000 MySQL servers, and are currently selling at least compromised 250,000 databases. Researchers are warning on an active ransomware campaign that’s targeting MySQL database servers. The ransomware, called PLEASE_READ_ME, has thus far breached at least 85,000 servers worldwide – and has posted at least 250,000 stolen databases on a website for sale. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. The attack exploits weak credentials on internet-facing MySQL servers, of which there are close to 5 million worldwide. Since first observing the ransomware campaign in January, researchers said that attackers have switched up their techniques to put more pressure on victims and to automate the payment process for the ransom. Click to register. “The attack starts with a password brute-force on the MySQL service. Once successful, the attacker runs a sequence of queries in the database, gathering data on existing tables and users,” said Ophir Harpaz and Omri Marom, researchers with Guardicore Labs, in a Thursday post. “By the end of execution, the victim’s data is gone – it’s archived in a zipped file which is sent to the attackers’ servers and then deleted from the database.” From there, the attacker leaves a ransom note in a table, named “WARNING,” which demands a ransom payment of up to 0.08 BTC. The ransom note tells victims (verbatim), “Your databases are downloaded and backed up on our servers. If we dont receive your payment in the next 9 Days, we will sell your database to the highest bidder or use them otherwise.” Researchers believe that the attackers behind this campaign have made at least $25,000 in the first 10 months of the year. Researchers said that PLEASE_READ_ME (so-called because it’s the name of the database that the attackers create on a compromised server) is an example of an untargeted, transient ransomware attack that does not spend time in the network besides targeting what’s required for the actual attack – meaning there’s typically no lateral movement involved. The attack may be simple, but it’s also dangerous, researchers warned, because it’s almost fileless. “There are no binary payloads involved in the attack chain, making the attack ‘malwareless,'” they said. “Only a simple script which breaks in the database, steals information and leaves a message.” That said, a backdoor user mysqlbackups’@’%’ is added to the database for persistence, providing the attackers with future access to the compromised server, researchers said. Attack Evolution Researchers first observed PLEASE_READ_ME attacks in January, in what they called the “first phase” of the attack. In this first phase, victims were required to transfer BTC directly to the attacker’s wallet. The attack timeline. Credit: Guardicore Labs The second phase of the ransomware campaign started in October, which researchers said marked an evolution in the campaign’s techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs). In the second phase, the attack evolved into a double-extortion attempt, researchers say – meaning attackers are publishing data while pressuring victims to pay the ransom. Here, attackers put up a website in the TOR network where payments can be made. Victims paying the ransom can be identified using tokens (as opposed to their IP/domain), researchers said. “The website is a good example of a double-extortion mechanism – it contains all leaked databases for which ransom was not paid,” said researchers. “The website lists 250,000 different databases from 83,000 MySQL servers, with 7 TB of stolen data. Up till now, [we] captured 29 incidents of this variant, originating from seven different IP addresses.” Ransomware attacks have continued to hammer hospitals, schools and other organizations in 2020. The ransomware tactic of “double extortion” first emerged in late 2019 by Maze operators – but has been rapidly adopted over the past few months by various cybercriminals behind the Clop, DoppelPaymer and Sodinokibi ransomware families. Looking forward, researchers warn that the PLEASE_READ_ME operators are trying to up their game by using double extortion at scale: “Factoring their operation will render the campaign more scalable and profitable,” they said.

"In its second month of compiling data, the new Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) technology revealed some significant changes amongst the most widespread malicious programs.The first table is based on statistics provided by our 2009 antivirus products. This table shows the malicious programs detected on users’ computers. Despite the changes, last month’s leader – Trojan DNSChanger.ech – remains at the top of this ranking. Overall, it is more than three times more widespread than the program which comes in second place. This indicates that there is quite a large-scale epidemic caused by DNSChanger which is affecting Western European countries in particular.There were a total of 16 new entries to the rankings this month, all of which were added to our antivirus databases in August 2008. Prominent among the newcomers is a group of six Trojan-Downloaders that have occupied 3rd to 8th place. By preventing these Trojan-Downloaders from fulfilling their primary task of downloading the main body of a malicious program, our antivirus products have also blocked mass downloads of other malicious programs to users’ computers.A number of Adware programs in the form of BHO (Browser Helper Object) also stand out. The large number of these programs is due to the fact that Internet Explorer – the browser such programs are designed to function on – is extremely popular.Last month’s statistics contained four classes of malicious and potentially unwanted programs (TrojWare, AdWare, VirWare and other MalWare). In August only TrojWare and AdWare remained. A total of 28940 different malicious and potentially unwanted programs were detected on users’ computers in August. That is an increase of more than 8000 on July’s figures and points to a significant increase in the number of in-the-wild threats.The second table provides data about the most common malicious programs among all infected objects detected.

This table shows the malicious programs detected on users’ computers. Despite the changes, last month’s leader – Trojan DNSChanger.ech – remains at the top of this ranking. Overall, it is more than three times more widespread than the program which comes in second place. This indicates that there is quite a large-scale epidemic caused by DNSChanger which is affecting Western European countries in particular.There were a total of 16 new entries to the rankings this month, all of which were added to our antivirus databases in August 2008. Prominent among the newcomers is a group of six Trojan-Downloaders that have occupied 3rd to 8th place. By preventing these Trojan-Downloaders from fulfilling their primary task of downloading the main body of a malicious program, our antivirus products have also blocked mass downloads of other malicious programs to users’ computers.A number of Adware programs in the form of BHO (Browser Helper Object) also stand out. The large number of these programs is due to the fact that Internet Explorer – the browser such programs are designed to function on – is extremely popular.Last month’s statistics contained four classes of malicious and potentially unwanted programs (TrojWare, AdWare, VirWare and other MalWare). In August only TrojWare and AdWare remained. A total of 28940 different malicious and potentially unwanted programs were detected on users’ computers in August. That is an increase of more than 8000 on July’s figures and points to a significant increase in the number of in-the-wild threats.The second table provides data about the most common malicious programs among all infected objects detected.

"Details of a patched privacy vulnerability in MyFitnessPal, a popular fitness and nutrition mobile application, were disclosed this week, three months after a fix was deployed. The details of a patched vulnerability in a popular mobile fitness application have been disclosed three months after a fixed was released. The flaw could have allowed a user to fetch the personal profile of another registered app user. MyFitnessPal deployed a fix on June 26 for a privacy flaw in an undocumented API that was reported two days earlier by Randy Westergren Jr., a software developer at XDA Developers. Bigger picture, this is more evidence of mobile applications extending their reach when it comes to consuming a user’s personal and device information. Fitness, health and medical mobile applications, in particular, have been hammered by privacy experts and called on the carpet by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for their thirst for consumers’ personal information. Apps that count calories, offer diet and exercise advice, and track fitness efforts consume an individuals’ data in order return feedback and suggestions. Yet it’s unclear in many cases how well this data is secured and how it’s shared, especially since it’s not stored by health practitioners or insurance agencies and falls outside the regulatory purview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). MyFitnessPal’s faux pas was more of a coding error resulting in an insecure direct object reference where anyone who was logged in was able to request and access any profile by manipulating the User ID parameter in the request, Westergren said. “The vulnerability existed because the application was insecurely handling the request, i.e., not verifying the requestor has permission to view it,” Westergren said, adding that an attacker could learn a host of information about a user, such as an email address or birthdate, that could leveraged into further attacks. “This can be used as a foothold for attackers.” Westergren said he verified the vulnerability only on the Android app. Requests for comment to MyFitnessPal went unanswered prior to publication. Westergren said he found the vulnerability after he started monitoring his personal interactions with the Android app. He said he proxied his Android device to run all requests through the free Fiddler debugging proxy. Via this process, he captured requests made to an undocumented MyFitnessPal API and noticed requests coming from the API for his personal information that anyone else could also access remotely. “Using [Fiddler], I was able to see all requests made from all apps. I started interacting with MFP and noticed this request. It stuck out because a developer generally wouldn’t request information for a logged in user by User ID,” Westergren said. “Rather, the safe way would be to request user information for the logged-in user. That is, not providing a User ID parameter at all, and determining the user to show server-side, based on the OAuth token passed.” Westergren said once a user enters their username and password, the API issues an OAuth token that can be used to authenticate future requests. “The app subsequently pulls profile information down in order to populate fields in the app (among other things),” he said. “This was exploitable by logging in as a valid user and using your token to directly request the profile information of other users.” Westergren said he built a proof-of-concept exploit in PHP to test this out by substituting the direct object with different user IDs. “To verify the vulnerability exists, the POC simply starts at my own user ID and increments the user ID parameter by one, then attempting to request the information of that user. It loops in this process until it finds a response with valid user information (presumably, not all user IDs will exist due to accounts being deleted/closed, etc.),” Westergren said. “At the time, I believe it only took five requests to confirm the existence of the vulnerability, i.e. the program looped five times (incrementing the user ID), before it found a valid user, returning the personal MFP information of that user.” He said MyFitnessPal was quick to respond to his report, which he submitted June 24. As a reward, Westergren said MyFitnessPal sent him a gift card and a personal thanks from the company’s vice president of engineering. : Mobile Security Privacy Vulnerabilities","T1082 System Information Discovery,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] Details of a patched privacy vulnerability in MyFitnessPal, a popular fitness and nutrition mobile application, were disclosed this week, three months after a fix was deployed.

The flaw is present in a huge percentage of the Android devices in use right now, and there’s now a Metasploit module available to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability was first disclosed in late August, but there has not been much in the way of public discussion of it. Exploiting the flaw is a straightforward matter and allows the attacker to bypass the same-origin policy in the Android browser. “By malforming a javascript: URL handler with a prepended null byte, the AOSP, or Android Open Source Platform (AOSP) Browser) fails to enforce the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) browser security control,” Tod Beardsley of Rapid7 said in an explanation of the flaw.  “What this means is, any arbitrary website (say, one controlled by a spammer or a spy) can peek into the contents of any other web page.

"Having appropriate security configurations requires your applications, servers and databases to be hardened in accordance with best practices. Sometimes it’s the little things that lead to big consequences. When it comes to cybersecurity, hacks more often than not stem from minor missteps – or even completely preventable, obvious mistakes. Common security mistakes and overlooked misconfigurations can open the door for attackers to drop malware or exfiltrate data – or even sabotage operations. Avoid the following top five configuration gaffes to reduce the threat exposure to your organization. Default Credentials It almost seems too obvious to include here, but leaving default usernames and passwords unconfigured for databases, installations and devices is, by far, one of the most common and easy mistakes to make. It’s also easy for a hacker to exploit: Leaving default credentials on network devices such as firewalls and routers, or even on operating systems, allows adversaries to simply use password-checking scanners to walk right into the network. In more skilled setups, hackers can simply stage a series of scripted attacks geared at brute-forcing devices by automatically trying various combinations of usernames and passwords again and again until one works; these usually focus on either default usernames and passwords, or basic passwords like “QWERTY” or “12345.” Attackers are getting savvier too. Researchers early last month uncovered a Python-based web scanner, Xwo, that can easily scan the web for exposed web services and default passwords. After collecting default MySQL, MongoDB, Postgre SQL and Tomcat credentials, the scanner forwards the results back to a command-and-control server. Bottom line: Even a 12-year-old with some internet access at home could carry out a major breach, just by using one of these freely available tools on the internet to check for default credentials. Password Reuse Having strong and complex passwords isn’t the only action that needs to be taken when securing your environment. Oftentimes, I see environments that leverage the same user account and password across every device in a fleet of endpoints. Sure, to an IT administrator this may be convenient, but it’s not necessary, and can grant an attacker the ability to pivot across every machine from just a single compromise of one of those computers. From there, attackers can leverage credential dumping programs to get their hands on the passwords, or even the hashes themselves, and then – it’s open season. Avoid password reuse at all costs and disable any accounts that are not required. Exposed Remote Desktop Services and Default Ports Any external-facing device that’s connected to the internet should have layers upon layers of protection to combat attempts to gain access from simple methods like a brute-force attack. Services like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, can provide administrators an interface to control computers remotely. Increasingly though, cybercriminals have taken to leveraging this exposed protocol when it’s not configured properly. While this attack vector has been popular for years, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a public-service announcement last fall encouraging businesses and private citizens to review and understand what type of access their networks allow, in order to minimize chances of a compromise. In particular, the FBI warned that ransomware like CrySiS and SamSam were increasingly targeting U.S. businesses through open RDP ports. This is happening both by brute-force and dictionary-style attacks, according to the alert; the latter is a technique for defeating an authentication mechanism by trying to determine a passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as all the words in a dictionary. Administrators should leverage a combination of strong/complex passwords, firewalls and access control lists to reduce the likelihood of a compromise. Delayed Software Patching This, like leaving default credentials on a server or system, may seem like another potential no-brainer: Keeping operating systems up to date and patched appropriately can prove significantly effective at preventing a breach. There are numerous exploits and vulnerabilities found daily, and while it can be difficult to keep up, it can be game over if administrators aren’t properly maintaining their patch levels. Ironically, in the breaches I’ve worked on where the attacker’s gotten in via a vulnerability, a majority of them have been bugs that are ridiculously old. There’s hype around detecting and preventing zero days, but the most common vulnerabilities that are exploited can be classified as digital fossils. It shouldn’t come as a surprise: attackers will continue exploiting old bugs as long as they’re effective. Logging Turned Off Disabled logging doesn’t necessarily allow an attacker to get into a system, but it does allow them to act like a ghost while they’re in there. Once in, hackers can move laterally through a network in search of data or assets to exfiltrate. Without logging, they can do all this while leaving zero tracks behind. This creates a true needle-in-a-haystack scenario for incident responders and forensic analysts, and makes their job that much harder when trying to reconstruct what may have happened during an incident or intrusion. Enabling logging and having it sent to a centralized location, like a security information and event management (SIEM) platform, is highly recommended. That data will provide the breadcrumbs needed by forensic analysts during an incident response investigation to reconstruct the attack and scope the intrusion. Additionally, it can prove highly useful when it comes to responding to threats that may have triggered an alert from an event in the collection of said logs. Having appropriate security configurations requires your applications, servers and databases to be hardened in accordance with best practices. Leaving these devices or platforms in a default or vulnerable state only makes the job of an attacker that much easier. Hackers look for low-hanging fruit. It may not happen right away, but they’ll discover these misconfigurations at some point, gain unauthorized access – and depending on their intent – steal sensitive data or cause damage. Avoid becoming an easy target and follow these precautionary steps to protect yourself and your data.

In more skilled setups, hackers can simply stage a series of scripted attacks geared at brute-forcing devices by automatically trying various combinations of usernames and passwords again and again until one works; these usually focus on either default usernames and passwords, or basic passwords like “QWERTY” or “12345.” Attackers are getting savvier too. Researchers early last month uncovered a Python-based web scanner, Xwo, that can easily scan the web for exposed web services and default passwords. After collecting default MySQL, MongoDB, Postgre SQL and Tomcat credentials, the scanner forwards the results back to a command-and-control server. Bottom line: Even a 12-year-old with some internet access at home could carry out a major breach, just by using one of these freely available tools on the internet to check for default credentials. Password Reuse Having strong and complex passwords isn’t the only action that needs to be taken when securing your environment. Oftentimes, I see environments that leverage the same user account and password across every device in a fleet of endpoints. Sure, to an IT administrator this may be convenient, but it’s not necessary, and can grant an attacker the ability to pivot across every machine from just a single compromise of one of those computers. From there, attackers can leverage credential dumping programs to get their hands on the passwords, or even the hashes themselves, and then – it’s open season. Avoid password reuse at all costs and disable any accounts that are not required. Exposed Remote Desktop Services and Default Ports Any external-facing device that’s connected to the internet should have layers upon layers of protection to combat attempts to gain access from simple methods like a brute-force attack. Services like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, can provide administrators an interface to control computers remotely. Increasingly though, cybercriminals have taken to leveraging this exposed protocol when it’s not configured properly. While this attack vector has been popular for years, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security issued a public-service announcement last fall encouraging businesses and private citizens to review and understand what type of access their networks allow, in order to minimize chances of a compromise. In particular, the FBI warned that ransomware like CrySiS and SamSam were increasingly targeting U.S. businesses through open RDP ports. This is happening both by brute-force and dictionary-style attacks, according to the alert; the latter is a technique for defeating an authentication mechanism by trying to determine a passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as all the words in a dictionary. Administrators should leverage a combination of strong/complex passwords, firewalls and access control lists to reduce the likelihood of a compromise. Delayed Software Patching This, like leaving default credentials on a server or system, may seem like another potential no-brainer: Keeping operating systems up to date and patched appropriately can prove significantly effective at preventing a breach. There are numerous exploits and vulnerabilities found daily, and while it can be difficult to keep up, it can be game over if administrators aren’t properly maintaining their patch levels. Ironically, in the breaches I’ve worked on where the attacker’s gotten in via a vulnerability, a majority of them have been bugs that are ridiculously old. There’s hype around detecting and preventing zero days, but the most common vulnerabilities that are exploited can be classified as digital fossils. It shouldn’t come as a surprise: attackers will continue exploiting old bugs as long as they’re effective. Logging Turned Off Disabled logging doesn’t necessarily allow an attacker to get into a system, but it does allow them to act like a ghost while they’re in there. Once in, hackers can move laterally through a network in search of data or assets to exfiltrate. Without logging, they can do all this while leaving zero tracks behind. This creates a true needle-in-a-haystack scenario for incident responders and forensic analysts, and makes their job that much harder when trying to reconstruct what may have happened during an incident or intrusion. Enabling logging and having it sent to a centralized location, like a security information and event management (SIEM) platform, is highly recommended. That data will provide the breadcrumbs needed by forensic analysts during an incident response investigation to reconstruct the attack and scope the intrusion. Additionally, it can prove highly useful when it comes to responding to threats that may have triggered an alert from an event in the collection of said logs. Having appropriate security configurations requires your applications, servers and databases to be hardened in accordance with best practices. Leaving these devices or platforms in a default or vulnerable state only makes the job of an attacker that much easier. Hackers look for low-hanging fruit. It may not happen right away, but they’ll discover these misconfigurations at some point, gain unauthorized access – and depending on their intent – steal sensitive data or cause damage. Avoid becoming an easy target and follow these precautionary steps to protect yourself and your data.

"GoDaddy, along with researchers from RSA Security and other companies, shut down tens of thousands of illegal established subdomains tied to the RIG Exploit Kit. Tens of thousands of illegally established subdomains used by criminals involved with the RIG Exploit Kit were recently taken down after an investigation revealed that hackers were phishing domain account credentials to set up these subdomains. Most of the subdomains used GoDaddy as the primary domain registrar. GoDaddy, in conjunction with research done by RSA Security and a handful of other security companies and independent researchers, was able to shut down the subdomains in May along with hundreds of IP addresses used as malware landing pages. The technique of creating subdomains with stolen credentials is known as domain shadowing. It’s unknown how big of a dent the takedowns put into the RIG Exploit Kit operations—as well as malvertising and spam campaigns swept up in the takedown—without full visibility into its infrastructure, RSA Security said. RIG is the most prevalent exploit kit in circulation after a devastating 2016 for these types of criminal enterprises brought a number of arrests that shut down Angler and other profitable operations. RSA Security published a report today describing this aspect of the RIG operation. Alex Cox, director of RSA’s FirstWatch Global research team, said the criminals were likely using information-stealing malware as part of a phishing campaign that targeted GoDaddy credentials Once the attackers had access to a victim’s account, they could add new subdomains to use as gates in attacks in order to redirect victims to IP addresses—most of them in Eastern Europe—hosting the exploit kit. Cox said that an investigation into exploit kit activity rendered patterns in the way URLs were presented to the test machines being attacked. RSA researchers were able to map domains to registrars and discovered that a good number of them were registered with GoDaddy, a RSA partner. Cox said 40,000 network subdomains were involved and 2,000 IP addresses, all related to RIG activity. Four campaigns surfaced between February and March, two of them using domain shadowing, and spreading Cerber ransomware and Dreambot banking malware among their payloads. RSA said that GoDaddy was able to kill all 40,000 domains at once in late March and the researchers helped build some automation that would help monitor and detect any similar domain shadowing activity going forward. “This was a coordinated phishing campaign where they were phishing for GoDaddy credentials,” Cox said, adding that it’s likely other registrars could be similarly involved. Domain shadowing is ingenious in that attackers understand that once someone registers a domain, it’s unlikely they’re going to give a second thought to their original DNS settings and other configuration information. “We were seeing hundreds of changes a day, so there was some automation involved.” Shadow domains were kept alive 24 hours on average and DNS records were cleaned up before new shadow domains were created, RSA said. The technique, meanwhile, neatly bypasses content filtering, Cox said. “In a modern corporation, if I’m running good.com and the content filtering proxy says all’s good and this is the right website, if someone hangs a bad domain off it, it will bypass content filtering in a simple way. “We see this often with criminals being adept at tracking how security technology is working and how we’re defending networks, and then building creative ways to get around that.” : Malware Vulnerabilities","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] GoDaddy, along with researchers from RSA Security and other companies, shut down tens of thousands of illegal established subdomains tied to the RIG Exploit Kit.

"Cisco today began the process of patching a zero-day vulnerability in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software exposed in the ShadowBrokers data dump. Cisco today began the process of patching a zero-day vulnerability in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software exposed in the ShadowBrokers data dump. Users on affected versions of ASA, 7.2, and 8.0 through 8.7, are urged to migrate soon to 9.1.7(9) or later. Newer versions that are also implicated—9.1 through 9.6—are expected to be updated in the next two days in some cases. “We have started publishing fixes for affected versions, and will continue to publish additional fixes for supported releases as they become available in the coming days,” Cisco’s Omar Santos said today in an updated advisory. The vulnerability lies in the SNMP code in ASA that could allow an attacker to crash the affected system or remotely execute arbitrary code. The updates address a buffer overflow vulnerability assigned CVE-2016-6366. An Equation Group exploit found in the data exposed by the ShadowBrokers called EXTRABACON targeted this flaw and allows a remote attacker who crafts special SNMP packets to take advantage of the issue. The Equation Group is largely believed to have ties to the NSA, and the ShadowBrokers’ exposure of the group’s files included 300MB of exploits, implants and other attacks targeting high-end networking gear from not only Cisco, but also Juniper, Fortinet, WatchGuard and others. The affected ASA software, Cisco said, runs in a number of its products including Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), Cisco Firepower 4100 Series, Cisco Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module, Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software, Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM), and Cisco Industrial Security Appliance 3000 Cisco PIX Firewalls.

Researchers from Silent Signal in Hungary, however, were able to add support to the original attack to cover newer versions of ASA up to 9.2(4), released a year ago. EXTRABACON was analyzed shortly following the ShadowBrokers’ disclosure by a researcher known as Xorcat, who confirmed that the Equation Group exploit for version 8.4(4) of the firewall appliance did indeed provide remote unauthenticated access over SSH or telnet. “We analyzed the leaked exploit and compared the shellcode for different versions. Then we started to test the exploit in our lab while comparing the firmware binaries of supported and unsupported versions,” said Silent Signal cofounder Balint Varga-Perke. “The main task (apart of setting up the test environment) was mainly to map the targeted code parts of the supported binary to the unsupported one, understand and fix up the leaked shellcode.” Prior to today’s patches, Cisco had provided its customers with IPS and Snort signatures that detect the vulnerability. : Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,Logic Behind Answers:","<s>[INST] Cisco today began the process of patching a zero-day vulnerability in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) software exposed in the ShadowBrokers data dump.

The maintainers of the Drupal content management system are warning users that any site owners who haven’t patched a critical vulnerability in Drupal Core disclosed earlier this month should consider their sites to be compromised. The vulnerability, which became public on Oct. 15, is a SQL injection flaw in a Drupal module that’s designed specifically to help prevent SQL injection attacks. Shortly after the disclosure of the vulnerability, attackers began exploiting it using automated attacks. One of the factors that makes this vulnerability so problematic is that it allows an attacker to compromise a target site without needing an account and there may be no trace of the attack afterward. “Automated attacks began compromising Drupal 7 websites that were not patched or updated to Drupal 7.32 within hours of the announcement of SA-CORE-2014-005 – Drupal core – SQL injection. You should proceed under the assumption that every Drupal 7 website was compromised unless updated or patched before Oct 15th, 11pm UTC, that is 7 hours after the announcement,” a statement released by the Drupal maintainers on Wednesday says. Attackers are using automated tools to exploit the vulnerability and in some cases are installing a back door on compromised systems and then patching the flaw in order to ensure that no other attacker can get access to the target site. “If you find that your site is already patched but you didn’t do it, that can be a symptom that the site was compromised – some attacks have applied the patch as a way to guarantee they are the only attacker in control of the site,” the Drupal statement says. “Attackers may have created access points for themselves (sometimes called ‘backdoors’) in the database, code, files directory and other locations. Attackers could compromise other services on the server or escalate their access. Removing a compromised website’s backdoors is difficult because it is not possible to be certain all backdoors have been found.” Drupal security team members recommend that site owners restore their sites from a known good backup if they didn’t patch their installations immediately after the vulnerability was disclosed. “The Drupal security team recommends that you consult with your hosting provider.

The GZ501W model camera contains a shared, hard-coded Amazon S3 credential used for storing saved video data in the Amazon cloud – so all users of the Guardzilla All-In-One Video Security System have the same password, and thus can access each other’s saved home video. And, any unauthenticated user can collect the data from any of the systems over the internet as long as they know the storage details. “Embedded S3 credentials have unlimited access to all S3 buckets provisioned for that account,” Rapid7 researchers explained in a Thursday post. “This was determined through static analysis of the firmware shipping with the device. Once the firmware was extracted and the root password ‘GMANCIPC’ was cracked, the Amazon S3 access key was recovered.” Using the access keys, an attacker can connect to the provisioned Amazon S3 account and access the various storage buckets associated with the service. These include the provocatively named “free-video-storage,” “free-video-storage-persist,” “premium-video-storage” and “premium-video-storage-persist.” This issue, discovered by Nick McClendon, Andrew Mirghassemi, Charles Dardaman, INIT_6 and Chris, all of 0DayAllDay, was disclosed to the vendor by Rapid7 – but the vendor hasn’t yet remediated the problem, according to the firm.

"Joomla on Tuesday patched a critical LDAP injection vulnerability that had lingered in the content management system for eight years. Attackers could use this bug to steal admin login credentials. Joomla on Tuesday patched a critical vulnerability that had lingered in the content management system for eight years. It’s unknown whether the bug had been publicly exploited before it was privately reported in July, but an attacker could have leveraged the flaw to steal administrator login credentials. The fix was included in the version 3.8 release this week. Specifically it addressed improper input sanitization in the LDAP authentication plugin, which affected versions 1.5.0 through 3.7.5 if Joomla was configured to use the plugin. Researchers at RIPS Technologies GmbH disclosed some details on the vulnerability on Wednesday. They said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability through the Joomla login page, taking advantage of the LDAP injection vulnerability in the login controller. With access to the admin control panel, an attacker could take over a site running on the CMS and potentially the webserver by uploading a custom extension and gaining remote code execution, RIPS CEO Johannes Dahse said. The risk, Dahse told Threatpost, is lessened somewhat since LDAP is not a common authentication option for Joomla. “It is not that commonly used and not the default authentication. But specifically large organizations use LDAP and could be an attractive target for attackers when they connected Joomla! to their LDAP server,” he said. Dahse explained that the vulnerability, CVE-2017-14596, can be triggered because user input is mixed unsanitized with the LDAP query markup that is passed to the LDAP search function. “The LDAP server stores the username and passwords of all users, similar to a SQL database server. For authentication, an LDAP query is performed by Joomla! that checks if the supplied user credentials match a pair on the server,” Dahse said. “This LDAP query uses the credentials entered in the Joomla! login form. Due to the lack of sanitization, however, an attacker can malform the LDAP query (similar to a SQL injection) by injecting LDAP query syntax into the credentials that then end up in the LDAP query and modify its action.” An attacker could do so by using wildcard characters (.MP4) and taking note of authentication error messages. The attacker could modify requests and progressively send rows of payloads that guess credentials character by character, Dahse said. “Each of these payloads yield exactly one out of two possible states which allow an adversary to abuse the server as an Oracle,” Dahse wrote in the report. “A filter bypass is necessary for exploitation… With an optimized version of these payloads, one bit per request can be extracted from the LDAP server which results in a highly efficient blind LDAP injection attack.” An attack can thus be automated with a script that checks character by character, he said. “Since the script can send multiple requests per second to the Joomla login form in an automated fashion, the attack can succeed within seconds depending on the password’s length,” Dahse said. The 3.8 Joomla release also contained a security update for another information disclosure bug in the core engine. This one was a logic bug in a SQL query could leak article introduction text when articles are archived.

"DHS sounded the alarm Monday on Dyre, the banking Trojan that’s been siphoning bank credentials from large enterprises and major financial institutions. The Department of Homeland Security formally sounded the alarm Monday on Dyre, the banking Trojan that’s been spotted siphoning banking credentials from both large enterprises and major financial institutions as of late. The warning came in the form of an alert from the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) informing the public of the malware, which is spread through spam and phishing emails. According to US-CERT, phishing emails peddling Dyre are now using malicious PDF attachments that leverage vulnerabilities (namely CVE-2013-2729) in old, unpatched versions of Adobe Reader to download the malware. Once it’s downloaded, it captures user login information and sends that on to attackers. It should come as no surprise that experts are encouraging users to use caution when it comes to opening attachments – especially those with suspicious-looking names like Invoice621785.pdf – and following links in emails. After it’ has been installed, the malware copies itself under C:\\Windows[RandomName].exe and disguises itself as a fake program, Google Update Service. The Trojan has existed in one form or another since early summer, but US-CERT is claiming this particular campaign started targeting recipients in mid-October. Last month Salesforce, a customer relationship management company, claimed the malware, also known as Dyreza, was taking aim at its customers. In that series of attacks, criminals used the malware to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to “read anything, even SSL traffic in clear text,” according to a write-up by the CSIS Security Group.

"A file delete vulnerability in WordPress can be elevated into a remote code execution vulnerability for plugins like WooCommerce. Up to 4 million online merchants who use the popular WooCommerce WordPress plugin are vulnerable to a file deletion vulnerability that could allow a rogue “shop manager” to escalate privileges and eventually execute remote code on impacted websites. Researchers at RIPS Technologies trace the bug to an unpatched design flaw in the privilege system of WordPress which can lead to an attack. While the flaw impacts many plugins on WordPress, one of the bigger impacted plugins is WooCommerce, an open source e-commerce plugin designed for small to large-sized online merchants using WordPress. WooCommerce powers 30 percent of all online stores — more than any other platform, according to WordPress. “The vulnerability allows shop managers to delete certain files on the server and then to take over any administrator account,” Simon Scannell, security researcher with RIPS Technologies, said in a Tuesday post. WooCommerce establishes “roles” for users ranging from customer, shop manager to admin. The shop manager role allows a user to manage all settings within WooCommerce platform, such as creating and editing products. After a payload is injected that deletes the WooCommerce plugin, an attacker in the “shop manager” role can access the “admin” role. A bad actor in the “shop manager” role could open the vulnerable log manager in WordPress and inject a payload to delete the WooCommerce plugin. By deleting this, it disables runtime restrictions on the plugin and the attacker can then edit and takeover the admin account. “Arbitrary file deletion vulnerabilities aren’t considered critical in most cases as the only thing an attacker can cause is a Denial of Service by deleting the index.php of the website,” Scannell wrote. “[We] detail how deleting certain plugin files in WordPress can disable security checks and then leads to a full site takeover.” An admin account takeover by shop managers occurs because WordPress assigns filters to different roles – in this case WooCommerce roles. Roles are independent of one another and exist even if a plugin is inactive. The roles are stored in the database as a core setting of WordPress – however, it means that they only get executed when the plugin is active. “The issue is that user roles get stored in the database and exist even if the plugin is disabled,” according to Scannell. “This means that if WooCommerce was disabled for some reason, the meta privilege check which restricts shop managers from editing administrators would not execute and the default behavior of allowing users with edit_users to edit any user, even administrators, would occur.” That would allow shop managers to update the password of admin accounts and take over the entire site. The exploit requires nothing more than an attacker being in control of an account with the user role “shop manager.” However, the exploit is not perfect – one major drawback is that when executing the exploit, all data is lost on the target site, Scannell said. A potential attacker could access the shop manager role via XSS vulnerabilities or phishing attacks, and then exploit the flaw to take over any administrator account and execute code on the server. Scannell reported the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in August, and a patch was released in October. Automattic, the company behind both WordPress and WooCommerce, did not respond to a request for further comment. WordPress has faced other varying flaws over the past year. In August, researchers outlined a proof-of-concept exploit that would enable bad actors to target a severe vulnerability in the PHP programming language behind several major CMS companies, including WordPress. And in June, WordPress patched two bugs rated “medium” in its tooltips plugin, including one that can allow bad actors to do anything an administrative user would be able to do on a WordPress site. : Editor's Picks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] A file delete vulnerability in WordPress can be elevated into a remote code execution vulnerability for plugins like WooCommerce.

"Malware can to worm its way onto Macs thanks to a recently discovered code-signing bypass flaw. Masquerading as an official Apple system file sounds like a wonderful way for malware to worm its way onto Macs – and a recently discovered code-signing bypass flaw allows bad code to do just that. The way some developers have implemented Apple’s official code-signing API can be exploited by attackers. Essentially, Apple makes an API available to developers that want to create a security function that verifies Apple files as being legitimate (by making sure the file’s code is signed). However, many of these developers have not used the API properly, so it introduces a vulnerability into the security product or function that allows for unsigned malicious code to appear to be signed by Apple. The result is that malware can fool vulnerable security products and services into thinking that it’s just another legitimate Apple file – so it slips past their security checks and onto the targeted machine. A host of security products, some open-source projects and security functions used by Google, Facebook and Yelp are among the affected code. A Word About Code-Signing Code-signing uses public key infrastructure to digitally sign files and bits of code in order to mark it as “trusted” and vendor-approved. In turn, verifying those signatures is a key process at the center of whitelisting, antivirus, incident response and threat-hunting efforts. Okta, which reported the vulns, explained that in macOS, code-signing focuses on Mach-O files, which target a specific native CPU architecture within the Mac ecosystem. The bypass involves a lack of code-signing verification for Mach-O files that are gathered (or “nested”) into the Fat/Universal file format. “This vulnerability exists in the difference between how the Mach-O loader loads signed code, versus how improperly used code-signing APIs check signed code,” explained Josh Pitts, staff engineer for Research and Exploitation at Okta, in an analysis released on Tuesday. Making the Exploit Work For the exploit to be successful, the first Mach-O binary in the Fat/Universal file must be legitimately signed by Apple; malicious binaries can then be appended (they must be ad-hoc signed and i386-compiled for an x86_64-bit target macOS, Pitts said). The legitimate file also has to have the CPU type in the Fat header set to a format that’s invalid or not native to the platform (for example, PPC). By doing this, the Mach-O loader will skip over the validly signed Apple binary and instead execute the malicious code. Meanwhile the code-signing API (Pitts tested “SecCodeCheckValidity”) will check the first binary – the legitimate Apple file – but will not check the certificate authority root of trust for the malicious file, instead marking it as approved and verified. The researcher’s initial proof of concept demonstrated the ease by which the exploit works: It “does not require admin access, does not require JIT’ing code or memory corruption to bypass code-signing checks. All that is required is a properly formatted Fat/Universal file, and [then] code-signing checks [are returned as being] valid.” The code-signing APIs contain flags that are supposed to ensure that all of these files are cryptographically signed. “However, these APIs fall short by default, and third-party developers will need to carve out and verify each architecture in the Fat/Universal file and verify that the identities match and are cryptographically sound,” Pitts said. He added that fixes are the “developer’s responsibility.” Patches But Further Concerns Known affected vendors and open-source projects have been notified and patches are available. These include: Carbon Black (CVE-2018-10407); Facebook (CVE-2018-6336); F-Secure (CVE-2018-10403); Google (CVE-2018-10405); Objective Development (CVE-2018-10470); Objective-See (CVE-2018-10404); VirusTotal (CVE-2018-10408); and Yelp (CVE-2018-10406). “However, more third-party security, forensics and incident response tools that use the official code-signing APIs are possibly affected,” Pitts warned, advising developers to use his PoCs to check their code. : Malware Vulnerabilities","T1055 Process Injection,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Malware can to worm its way onto Macs thanks to a recently discovered code-signing bypass flaw.

These include: Carbon Black (CVE-2018-10407); Facebook (CVE-2018-6336); F-Secure (CVE-2018-10403); Google (CVE-2018-10405); Objective Development (CVE-2018-10470); Objective-See (CVE-2018-10404); VirusTotal (CVE-2018-10408); and Yelp (CVE-2018-10406). “However, more third-party security, forensics and incident response tools that use the official code-signing APIs are possibly affected,” Pitts warned, advising developers to use his PoCs to check their code. : Malware Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1055 Process Injection,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"

"Reading Time: 3 minutes Businesses are on a helter-skelter as the current waves of cyber attacks make them double their efforts in protecting their operations as well as their customers. Their online reputation is at stake – along with their assets and the all-important customer data. And if the results of a Herajavec Group Study (a 2016 cybercrime report)  are anything to go by, things aren’t going to get any better for these businesses in the near future. So it’s time they brace up and invest in a ‘cyber security threat handling’ program which has enough mileage to stand the test of time in this modern-day ‘security threat-ridden digital world’. So now the question is: what should your ‘security threat handling program’ contain to ward-off the various security threats? Here are some suggestions: 1. Increase Customer Trust by Implementing SSL. Credit card leaks have been much talked about since the Target hack of 2013 which compromised some 70 million customers. Obviously, customers are being warned against posting their credit card data and this is likely to affect online businesses. E-commerce websites are the worst-affected, as indicated by the ‘shopping cart abandonment rates‘ which consequently spiked up after this infamous incident. As an online business, you can boost customer confidence in two ways. By making sure your business site has updated SSL Certificates and By having a strong HTTPS encryption. Although this doesn’t imply ‘absolute protection’,SSL Certificates do ease user concerns. This will in turn improve conversion rates and also make it more difficult for hackers to access any data being transmitted to and fro between your site and the users. 2. Protect Your Assets against Ransomware. Various ransomware attacks – WannaCry and Petya to name a few – have been particularly rampant this year, forcing online businesses to adopt counter-measures to safeguard themselves. A reputed endpoint security solution like Comodo Endpoint Security offers good protection against such forms of ransomware attacks.   3. Deploy Remote Monitoring and Management Tools. Online businesses like IT Service Providers cannot handle everything on their own. They cannot operate efficiently without delegating some of their work – mostly related to managing client IT infrastructures. This is where Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools come in handy. Simply put, remote monitoring helps these IT Service Providers handle their clientele’s problems without having to visit their clients via remoting capabilities. Some of the benefits they offer: Enhanced Security: When your clientele’s systems are automatically monitored around the clock (something a human will find tough to accomplish) – Website security threats can be dealt with efficiently. This significantly decreases the chances of your company’s data from being compromised. Streamlined Maintenance: Security enhancement related maintenance tasks like keeping workstations up-to-date and carrying out regular health checks can be streamlined and automated via Remote Monitoring and Management tools. This, in turn, increases the organization’s security. 4. Protect your Network with IoT Encryption. With the rise of IoT (Internet of Things), the number of devices connecting to a network has likewise increased dramatically. Unfortunately, while we are busy protecting our networks, we forget to protect these IoT devices like smart refrigerator or TV which can connect to the internet and thereby inject potential malware into almost any network. 5. Find Out Where Things are Going Wrong. If your online business is not doing well, one of the possible key reasons could be due to your visitor’s trust. Your website visitors might question your business’ credibility and therefore shy away from sharing their personal information. To determine where things are going wrong and correct them accordingly, you can use a number of analytics tools – there are some specifically for e-commerce websites like  . They come in handy as these tools study visitor behavior on your website and address those visitor security related concerns.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes With another year nearly behind us, this holiday season is the perfect time to start considering next year’s resolutions. But while setting personal goals surrounding health, fitness, and self-improvement are admirable, they shouldn’t be the only considerations you make going into 2020. Two thousand nineteen proved to be yet another record-breaking year in cyber-related crimes, with the global cost of ransomware and data breaches reaching more than $2 billion. The most surprising fact surrounding this statistic, however, is that only three out of 10 businesses are well-equipped enough to combat a modern-day cyberattack. This makes it imperative that cybersecurity awareness and planning be a primary objective for any organization going into the new year. Here are some top cybersecurity resolutions your businesses should make and stick to going into 2020. Establish Better Email Security Practices For many years now, email has been the primary method of communication for businesses. In that same amount of time, however, cyber attackers have been using company inboxes as a way of gaining access to sensitive user information and critical business systems. Organizations need to be aware of the hidden dangers that digital communications can unlock and protect themselves accordingly. It is no longer adequate to rely solely on an employee’s judgment when deciding on whether or not to open a seemingly suspicious email. Due to social engineering and advanced malicious scripting tools, phishing emails and malware-injected correspondences are getting harder and harder to spot. Companies should seriously consider investing in high-performance email security solutions that are designed to not only detect these dangerous emails but prevent them from making their way to employees’ inboxes altogether. Enforce Stronger Password Management There are three common mistakes the majority of companies and their employees still make when choosing passwords for their accounts. Namely, these are having weak password formats, using that same format for multiple accounts, and not changing passwords often enough. Password management can be a nightmare for most people, especially when trying to remember passwords for multiple user accounts. Many people, including employees, ease this pain by using the same password across most of their entire list of accounts. This is an extremely dangerous practice as it widens a company’s attack service if only one of those accounts is hacked and login credentials are stolen. Users should be formatting their passwords with at least 12 characters and use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters wherever applicable. Password managers are another valuable tool that use powerful 256-bit AES encryption to allow users to store several passwords for their various accounts. This allows them to have strong, unique logins for all the sites they visit while also having the ability to change them regularly. Utilize Secure Web Browsing Tools If the rise of ransomware has taught us one thing, it’s that cyber attackers don’t need to infiltrate your business to cause catastrophic damage – they can simply let you come to them. Browsing to and using unencrypted websites allows all of your activity on those sites to be monitored by attackers while also making it possible to inject malicious scripts directly onto your computer and infect host servers and systems. Comodo’s Secure Web Gateway is a web filtering solution that lets companies set up policies to block harmful site categories, and more.  Most businesses don’t enforce the use of specific web browsers with their employees so there is a high likelihood that unencrypted websites are being visited on a daily basis, increasing the chances of an attack or undetected data breach. An effective way to avoid this is by ensuring all employees use a security-first web browser. This ensures online privacy, and incorporates end-to-end protection when visiting encrypted and unencrypted websites. As you head into the new year and think about better ways to keep yourself and your business protected, it’s important to remember that it’s often the smaller improvements we make that can make a large difference in avoiding cyber attacks. However, if your resolution is to ensure your business maintains the highest security posture it can going into 2020 and beyond, Contact Comodo to see how our comprehensive portfolio of integrated security solutions can work for you.

"Ekaterina Kilyusheva, head of the Information Security Analytics Research Group at Positive Technologies, offers a blueprint for locking up the fortress. When it comes to security, some of tomorrow’s biggest threats will come from yesterday’s vulnerabilities. In that regard, the network perimeter is a primary concern. Network security has been discussed for years, and many best practices are well documented. And yet, according to Positive Technologies research, 84 percent of companies still have high-risk vulnerabilities on the perimeter, more than half (58 percent) have high-risk flaws with publicly available exploits, and – alarmingly — 26 percent are still vulnerable to WannaCry. All of these factors, combined with the switch to remote work, have caused an increase in attacks exploiting vulnerabilities on the network perimeter, from five percent in Q1 2020 to 26 percent in the same quarter this year. One reason why companies can become targets is because low-skilled hackers often sell network access to more experienced criminal groups, such as ransomware operators. Exploits are now available for 10 percent of vulnerabilities detected on the perimeter, and that means even those without professional programming skills or experience in reverse engineering can exploit them. So what measures should be taken to protect the network perimeter today, and which flaws are most commonly present in companies? Step 1. Get Rid of the Deadwood During a security assessment, even a cursory glance at any company’s services available online can say a lot about its security level. If only a few services are available, they’re usually protected by secure configuration and recent software updates that significantly facilitate eventual reconfiguration. Building a secure perimeter must start from resource inventory–in other words, from detecting and disabling active services that are not being used, as well as insecure protocols, and making sure that accessible interfaces truly need to be available online. Which services are most frequently available to attackers? In Positive Technologies testing, we found every single company had TCP network ports 80 and 443 open on the perimeter. As a rule, these network ports have applications running on Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx and other web servers. By identifying a web server and its version, attackers can select relevant exploits. Our research proved that 16 percent of web-server vulnerabilities have publicly available exploits. The availability of TCP network port 80 means that data can be exchanged via the HTTP protocol. And as we know, HTTP traffic is transmitted without encryption, meaning attackers can intercept it. Analysis also revealed remote access and administration interfaces available on numerous resources, such as SSH, RDP or Telnet. Having these interfaces available to everyone on the internet is dangerous because they can allow any criminal to conduct brute-force attacks, so access to them should be limited. Let’s remember that attacks on remote-access services have been among the main cybercrime trends of 2020 and 2021. Organizations should also abandon the use of Telnet (which was found in 21 percent of companies), because it transmits credentials in cleartext, and replace it with SSH. To make SSH connections more secure, use public key authentication, block SSH access for the root account, and use a non-standard port to guard against mass automated attacks. At 84 percent of companies, TCP port 25 is open with the SMTP email service available on the perimeter. Data is transmitted in cleartext via SMTP, which means that just like with HTTP, attackers can intercept traffic and read corporate emails. In addition, insecure configuration of mail servers may leak corporate email addresses. The collected corporate email addresses can be used to brute-force credentials for network perimeter resources or remote access to the internal network, or to send phishing emails. Step 2. Keep Software Up-to-Date Positive Technologies research found that almost half of all detected vulnerabilities (47 percent) can be eliminated by simply installing the latest software updates. However, the same research also found that all companies had problems with keeping software up to date. In fact, we found software that had reached its end of life at 42 percent of organizations, and we know at that point, developers stop releasing security updates. For example, 32 percent of companies still use PHP 5 applications, even though support for that language ended in January 2019. As a result, 30 percent of vulnerabilities detected in outdated software versions and web-application code are among the most dangerous program code errors, according to MITRE. This MITRE ranking includes the most common critical errors that can be easily found and exploited by attackers in order to steal information, cause denial of service, or obtain full control over a vulnerable application. Our research into network vulnerabilities also found that more than half of companies have vulnerabilities allowing execution of arbitrary code on the server, and 16 percent of these flaws have publicly available exploits, meaning the organizations had not patched for known vulnerabilities. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of these vulnerabilities are of high severity. The most common vulnerability was CVE-2017-12617 in Apache Tomcat, which is dangerous because attackers can exploit it to upload a JSP file to a vulnerable server and execute code contained in this file. In the worst case, this could let attackers breach the network perimeter and access the local network, opening up the possibility for them to then steal confidential data, encrypt files with ransomware, gain access to critical business systems or obtain full control over the infrastructure. Step 3. Make Sure Configurations Are Safe Positive Technologies testing of network perimeters found that all companies had hosts that disclosed technical information: The contents of configuration files, routing to scanned hosts, OS versions and supported protocol versions. The more information about the system attackers can collect, the higher the chance of a successful attack. Insecure configuration of services can also cause data leaks: For example, criminals can swipe detailed information about the system if the Community String value for the SNMP protocol — normally used to monitor various settings of network devices —  is set as public or private. Ensure that all interfaces are configured securely. Pay particular attention to the versions of supported protocols. For example, insecure versions of the SSL/TLS protocol can lead to disclosure of confidential information (see vulnerabilities CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2014-3566 and CVE-2013-2566). Keep in mind that some vulnerabilities are related to the use of weak cryptographic mechanisms and keys. SSL certificates of 68 percent of companies use SHA-1 and MD5 hash functions. There are well-known attacks aimed at exploiting collisions in these algorithms, allowing attackers to compromise the certificate. And, certificates at 53 percent of companies use RSA keys with a length of 1,024 bits or less. A weak secret RSA key in SSL/TLS allows an attacker to intercept a session by masquerading as a legitimate server. The recommended NIST length of an RSA key is at least 2,048 bits, so be sure to use strong cryptography. Step 4.

When it comes to security, some of tomorrow’s biggest threats will come from yesterday’s vulnerabilities. In that regard, the network perimeter is a primary concern. Network security has been discussed for years, and many best practices are well documented. And yet, according to Positive Technologies research, 84 percent of companies still have high-risk vulnerabilities on the perimeter, more than half (58 percent) have high-risk flaws with publicly available exploits, and – alarmingly — 26 percent are still vulnerable to WannaCry. All of these factors, combined with the switch to remote work, have caused an increase in attacks exploiting vulnerabilities on the network perimeter, from five percent in Q1 2020 to 26 percent in the same quarter this year. One reason why companies can become targets is because low-skilled hackers often sell network access to more experienced criminal groups, such as ransomware operators. Exploits are now available for 10 percent of vulnerabilities detected on the perimeter, and that means even those without professional programming skills or experience in reverse engineering can exploit them. So what measures should be taken to protect the network perimeter today, and which flaws are most commonly present in companies? Step 1. Get Rid of the Deadwood During a security assessment, even a cursory glance at any company’s services available online can say a lot about its security level. If only a few services are available, they’re usually protected by secure configuration and recent software updates that significantly facilitate eventual reconfiguration. Building a secure perimeter must start from resource inventory–in other words, from detecting and disabling active services that are not being used, as well as insecure protocols, and making sure that accessible interfaces truly need to be available online. Which services are most frequently available to attackers? In Positive Technologies testing, we found every single company had TCP network ports 80 and 443 open on the perimeter. As a rule, these network ports have applications running on Apache HTTP Server, Apache Tomcat, Nginx and other web servers. By identifying a web server and its version, attackers can select relevant exploits. Our research proved that 16 percent of web-server vulnerabilities have publicly available exploits. The availability of TCP network port 80 means that data can be exchanged via the HTTP protocol. And as we know, HTTP traffic is transmitted without encryption, meaning attackers can intercept it. Analysis also revealed remote access and administration interfaces available on numerous resources, such as SSH, RDP or Telnet. Having these interfaces available to everyone on the internet is dangerous because they can allow any criminal to conduct brute-force attacks, so access to them should be limited. Let’s remember that attacks on remote-access services have been among the main cybercrime trends of 2020 and 2021. Organizations should also abandon the use of Telnet (which was found in 21 percent of companies), because it transmits credentials in cleartext, and replace it with SSH. To make SSH connections more secure, use public key authentication, block SSH access for the root account, and use a non-standard port to guard against mass automated attacks. At 84 percent of companies, TCP port 25 is open with the SMTP email service available on the perimeter. Data is transmitted in cleartext via SMTP, which means that just like with HTTP, attackers can intercept traffic and read corporate emails. In addition, insecure configuration of mail servers may leak corporate email addresses. The collected corporate email addresses can be used to brute-force credentials for network perimeter resources or remote access to the internal network, or to send phishing emails. Step 2. Keep Software Up-to-Date Positive Technologies research found that almost half of all detected vulnerabilities (47 percent) can be eliminated by simply installing the latest software updates. However, the same research also found that all companies had problems with keeping software up to date. In fact, we found software that had reached its end of life at 42 percent of organizations, and we know at that point, developers stop releasing security updates. For example, 32 percent of companies still use PHP 5 applications, even though support for that language ended in January 2019. As a result, 30 percent of vulnerabilities detected in outdated software versions and web-application code are among the most dangerous program code errors, according to MITRE. This MITRE ranking includes the most common critical errors that can be easily found and exploited by attackers in order to steal information, cause denial of service, or obtain full control over a vulnerable application. Our research into network vulnerabilities also found that more than half of companies have vulnerabilities allowing execution of arbitrary code on the server, and 16 percent of these flaws have publicly available exploits, meaning the organizations had not patched for known vulnerabilities. Almost two-thirds (64 percent) of these vulnerabilities are of high severity. The most common vulnerability was CVE-2017-12617 in Apache Tomcat, which is dangerous because attackers can exploit it to upload a JSP file to a vulnerable server and execute code contained in this file. In the worst case, this could let attackers breach the network perimeter and access the local network, opening up the possibility for them to then steal confidential data, encrypt files with ransomware, gain access to critical business systems or obtain full control over the infrastructure. Step 3. Make Sure Configurations Are Safe Positive Technologies testing of network perimeters found that all companies had hosts that disclosed technical information: The contents of configuration files, routing to scanned hosts, OS versions and supported protocol versions. The more information about the system attackers can collect, the higher the chance of a successful attack. Insecure configuration of services can also cause data leaks: For example, criminals can swipe detailed information about the system if the Community String value for the SNMP protocol — normally used to monitor various settings of network devices —  is set as public or private. Ensure that all interfaces are configured securely. Pay particular attention to the versions of supported protocols. For example, insecure versions of the SSL/TLS protocol can lead to disclosure of confidential information (see vulnerabilities CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2014-3566 and CVE-2013-2566). Keep in mind that some vulnerabilities are related to the use of weak cryptographic mechanisms and keys. SSL certificates of 68 percent of companies use SHA-1 and MD5 hash functions. There are well-known attacks aimed at exploiting collisions in these algorithms, allowing attackers to compromise the certificate. And, certificates at 53 percent of companies use RSA keys with a length of 1,024 bits or less. A weak secret RSA key in SSL/TLS allows an attacker to intercept a session by masquerading as a legitimate server. The recommended NIST length of an RSA key is at least 2,048 bits, so be sure to use strong cryptography. Step 4. Use an Effective Vulnerability Management Process International vulnerability databases annually publish information about thousands of new flaws. In addition, corporate IT infrastructures constantly go through changes, each of which potentially entails a security risk. All this makes vulnerability management a complex task. Ensuring effective vulnerability management requires proper instrumental solutions, but with modern security assessment tools, companies can go beyond automating resource inventories and vulnerability searches to assess security policy compliance across the entire infrastructure. Step 5. Test the Robustness of the Perimeter Combine automated scanning with penetration testing. Automated scanning is only the first step toward achieving an acceptable level of security; subsequent steps should include verification, triage and remediation of risks and their causes.

"Voter registration data belonging to the entirety of Chicago’s electoral roll—1.8 million records—was found a week ago in an Amazon Web Services bucket. Voter registration data belonging to the entirety of Chicago’s electoral roll—1.8 million records—was found a week ago in an Amazon Web Services bucket configured for public access. The data was a backup stored in AWS by Election Systems & Software (ES&S), a voting machine and election management systems vendor based in Omaha, Ne. Researchers from UpGuard made the discovery last Saturday and privately reported the leak to a government regulator who connected them to the Chicago FBI field office. The FBI then notified ES&S, which immediately pulled down the data from Amazon. Amazon buckets are configured to be private by default and require some kind of authentication to access what’s stored in them. For some reason, ES&S misconfigured its bucket to public months ago, opening the possibility that others had accessed the data before UpGuard. ES&S confirmed in a statement that the copy of the backup file, a .bak or Microsoft SQL backup file, contained 1.8 million names, addresses, dates of birth, partial Social Security numbers and in some cases, driver’s license and state identification numbers. Jon Hendren, director of strategy at UpGuard and the person who found the exposed data, said that the databases also included fields indicating whether a voter was active. About 1.5 million of the records belonged to active voters. There were two folders in the AWS bucket, Hendren said, containing about a dozen backup files, about 12GB in all. Also in the folder was some information on ES&S security procedures that included the hashed email passwords of ES&S employees. While the personal information of voters exposes them to fraud via phishing and other scams, the employee data poses a serious threat in another direction. “There’s no telling how far a nefarious actor could get if they’re willing to use those credentials,” said Chris Vickery, UpGuard director of cyber risk research who has found other similar leaks via Amazon buckets. “There’s no way to tell if they would be able to infiltrate ES&S networks or systems, but the potential is there.” ES&S sells a number of different electronic voting systems and vote tabulators. The City of Chicago is a customer of theirs, and it’s unknown what type of work was being done with the data or why it was being stored in a publicly accessible bucket. “The backup files on the AWS server did not include any ballot information or vote totals and were not in any way connected to Chicago’s voting or tabulation systems,” ES&S said in a statement. “These backup files had no impact on any voters’ registration records and had no impact on the results of any election.” The City of Chicago Election Board said it was notified of the breach by the FBI last Saturday afternoon at 5:37. By 9:44 p.m., the board said ES&S had taken the server offline. The board said in a statement that no systems, websites or servers managed by the board were affected and that none of its sites or networks reside on AWS. “We were deeply troubled to learn of this incident, and very relieved to have it contained quickly,” said Chicago Election Board Chairwoman Marisel A. Hernandez. “We have been in steady contact with ES&S to order and review the steps that must be taken, including the investigation of ES&S’s AWS server. We will continue reviewing our contract, policies and practices with ES&S. We are taking steps to make certain this can never happen again.” Vickery said it’s unknown whether anyone else accessed the data, nor whether ES&S had logging configured and enabled. “Given the bucket name was easy to guess (“Chicago DB”) and had been up many months before I noticed it, I would say the chances of me being the first one are slim,” Hendren said. Vickery added that ES&S websites do not have SSL enabled. A web-scanning and ranking service called CSTAR run by UpGuard determined the ES&S also falls short in that it does not have HSTS turned on, nor does it use HttpOnly cookies, secure cookies, DMARC or DNSSEC. It also displays the server information header. : Government Privacy Vulnerabilities","T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1566 Phishing","<s>[INST] Voter registration data belonging to the entirety of Chicago’s electoral roll—1.8 million records—was found a week ago in an Amazon Web Services bucket.

"In comparison with previous months, October was fairly quiet, with relatively few new malicious programs appearing. Epidemics and outbreaks were at a minimum. However, spy and theft programs continued to be widespread, and new vulnerabilities were detected. Below are the highlights of the previous month.Firstly, another vulnerability was discovered in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Patches can be downloaded from the Microsoft site, and a detailed description of the vulnerability is available in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-032. A previously identified vulnerability was connected with the processing of BMP and JPEG graphics files; now Microsoft metafiles, WMF/EMF, have been added to the list. This is another buffer overrun vulnerability – an attacker can use it to cause malicious code built-in to an infected graphic file to be executed. This vulnerability is potentially more dangerous than the BMP/ JPEG processing vulnerability, as Microsoft Windows uses the contents of WMF/EMF files to create icons for these files. This makes it possible to exploit the vulnerability simply by causing the operating system to create an icon for the appropriate graphics file.Secondly, even though October was a relatively quiet month in terms of malicious code, we nevertheless detected some new email worms. All of them followed the recent trend where such worms have a short life-cycle. The new representatives of the Bagle and Mydoom families were all short lived, propagating for no more than 2 -3 days before ceasing to work. I-Worm.Mydoom.aa, I-Worm.Mydoom.ab, I-Worm.Bagle.atand I-Worm.Bagle.au were more or less clones, using the source code of previous worms from their respective families. Due to this, there was hardly any difference between the new versions.October resurrected I-Worm.Zafi, with the new version, Zafi.c, appearing after a fairly lengthy break. It was detected right at the end of the month, and it relatively interesting from an evolutionary point of view. The worm’s authors are continuing to develop their social engineering skills: the texts infected messages contain are becoming more and more varied. The text constructor used has undergone considerable modification since the last version of Zafi. In spite of the relatively small volume of text in the constructor, the worm’s authors have achieved a wide range of possible variants; the texts are also now both more coherent and more enticing.The list of servers which the worm is intended to conduct DoS attacks against is another point of interest. In addition to google.com and Microsoft.com, the list also includes the Hungarian prime-minister’s site – perhaps a return to the politics of Zafi.a?All of the above worms were kept company by a new worm, I-Worm.Bagz.a. This worm is able to infect computers not only via email, but also if the user visits certain sites which contain malicious scripts – these scripts then install the worm on the victim machine. This version of Bagz did not propagate very widely or very rapidly, but the family seems set to evolve; it’s therefore likely that more successful version of the worm will be detected in the not-too-distant future.Worm.Win32.Opasoft.s could also be judged one of October’s novelties. Although the family is not new, there have been no new versions of this malicious program for a long time. This latest version caused a significant outbreak in the Russian Federation. However, it’s difficult to predict what will happen in the future – it may be that we will see renewed activity, or it may be that the worm will once again disappear from the landscape for an undefined time.As a conclusion to this round-up, spy and theft programs deserve a mention for the high level activity which they demonstrated this month. Several families of remote administration programs (Backdoor.Win32.Agobot, Backdoor.Win32.Rbot, Backdoor.Win32.Wootbot and Backdoor.Win32.SdBot) also come under this umbrella.Trojan.PSW.LdPinch, Trojan.PSW.PdPinch, and the strictly regional Trojan.PSW.Lmir, Trojan.PSW.Lineage, TrojanSpy.Win32.Bancos and TrojanSpy.Win32.Banker were all active this month, as were TrojanSpy.HTML.Citifraud, TrojanSpy.HTML.Bankfraud and TrojanSpy.HTML.Sunfraud – these last three carrying out fraudulent mailings as part of phishing attacks.This high level of activity seems to indicate that such programs remain in demand by fraudsters, and there is no reason to suppose that this trend will be reversed.The month gone by has shown us that the Trojan programs listed above are following a recent trend – familiar malicious programs are compressed and/ or encrypted in new ways in order to avoid antivirus scanners.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] In comparison with previous months, October was fairly quiet, with relatively few new malicious programs appearing.

"The OwnStar attack that hacker Samy Kamkar revealed late last month can be used against not only GM vehicles, but cars manufactured by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Chrysler, as well. The attack allows Kamkar to intercept the traffic from nearby mobile phones that have specific apps open that control safety and security features on their vehicles. Kamkar built a Raspberry Pi-based device he calls OwnStar to execute the attack, which he demonstrated originally against the GM OnStar RemoteLink app. The device can intercept the traffic, send special packets to the device, gain credentials and then locate, unlock, and start the victim’s vehicle. “After a user opens the RemoteLink mobile app on their phone near my OwnStar device, OwnStar intercepts the communications and sends specially crafted packets to the mobile device to acquire additional credentials then notifies me, the attacker, about the vehicle that I indefinitely have access to, including its location, make, and model,” Kamkar said in a video demonstrating the device. Shortly after Kamkar disclosed the attack, which took advantage of a flaw in the RemoteLink app, GM issued a fix. But Kamkar said that he discovered the attack also works against the mobile apps used by BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Chrysler owners. The BMW Remote, Mercedes-Benz mbrace, and Chrysler Uconnect apps all are vulnerable to the attack, Kamkar said. The main problem is that the apps fail to validate SSL certificates. Kamkar has been taking dead aim at vehicle security in recent weeks. Last week at DEF CON, he gave a talk on the topic and disclosed details of another device he’s built called RollJam that enables him to intercept signals from car remotes and replay them later to unlock the vehicles. The device can be hidden under a car and works against vehicles that use rolling, rather than fixed, codes. “So when you are walking towards your car, you hit the unlock button — because it’s jammed, the car can’t hear it, however my device is also listening so my device hears your signal (and removes the jamming signal because it knows what to remove).

"Reading Time: 2 minutes Every cybersecurity responsible person knows the power of paranoia. Assume nothing, test everything, and then do it again. Here are three basic questions to ask: 1. How close a relationship does your cybersecurity provider have with the people who you want to be protected against? If your government will not do business with them because they believe there is a significant chance that they are working with the government of another country (for example Russia), maybe you shouldn’t be doing business with them either. 2. Ask your existing cyber security vendor if their solution allows a file that is not currently known by their research to be malware to execute on your machine with unfettered access. If they say yes or try to avoid giving you a simple answer, then you are at risk from Zero day attacks (A marketing term to justify malware not yet identified as malware by your security vendor). 3. Does your cyber security vendor talk a lot about heuristics, machine learning and artificial intelligence? Then ask them how they handle the halting problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). If they have no idea what you are asking, then it’s very likely that they are relying on just technology to assess technology, creating a weakness in their security which is unsolvable, and will lead to your business having a certainty of exposure to cyber-risk.

"Today, botnets are one of the principal technologies used by cybercriminals. Botnet technologies have been developing for several years, giving rise to decentralized botnets and botnets managed via social networks, with drive-by downloads becoming the principal method of infection. In this respect, 2011 was a relatively uneventful year and cybercriminals came up with nothing radically new. But everything changed in early 2012.In Q1 2012, cybercriminals created a botnet using a ‘fileless’ bot for the first time. Security researchers discovered a mobile botnet that was comparable in size with typical Windows botnets, as well as a botnet of more than half a million Apple computers running Mac OSX.In Q1 2012, we discovered a botnet created using a new technology: the botmaster used a ‘fileless’ bot. This malware belongs to a very rare breed of malicious programs which exist only in the computer’s RAM.The problem manifested itself in anomalies on infected computers: they began sending network requests to third-party resources after visiting some popular Russian websites, then in some cases encrypted files appeared on their hard drives. At the same time, no new executable files appeared on hard drives. Further analysis helped to identify the entire chain involved in infecting computers and creating the botnet, which was far from trivial.In the first stage, a computer was infected via a drive-by attack using a Java exploit for the CVE-2011-3544 vulnerability. The link, which redirected users to the website containing the exploit, was inserted in a teaser ad displayed on news sites. The teaser ad was distributed via AdFox, a Russian banner network.After successfully exploiting the vulnerability, the exploit injected a malicious DLL directly into the memory of the Java process instead of downloading the malicious file to the hard drive. After being successfully injected and launched, the malware acted on behalf of the Java process, collecting information on the sites visited by the user. If these included bank-related resources, then the Lurk Trojan, which targets users’ online-banking credentials, was installed on the computer.Thanks to the professional actions of Kaspersky Lab experts, AdFox staff and a researcher who chose to remain anonymous, the infection has been curbed.Although the malicious process remained in RAM only until the operating system was restarted, the infection spread via popular websites. The cybercriminals were able to infect computers each day, thereby maintaining the bot population. It is worth noting that virtually no traces of the infection or of data collection remained on the computer’s hard drive after the operating system was restarted.In this incident, two familiar technologies – exploitation of vulnerabilities and injection into a legitimate process without saving a file on the hard drive – were combined in a single piece of dangerous malware. Whenever a ‘fileless’ bot is used, it is very difficult to identify the computers that make up the botnet, since no new executable files appear on the hard drive and the cybercriminals perform all their actions on behalf of Java, which is a legitimate process. Although patching is effective against this and similar threats, some users fail to patch their systems on a timely basis. This means that we may yet come across similar malware in the future, though not on a mass scale: this is, after all, rather sophisticated.In our Q3 2011 report, we mentioned that malware developers for mobile devices had selected Android OS as their platform of choice. In Q1 2012, we detected over 5,000 (5,444) malicious programs for the platform. The total number of malicious programs targeting Android has increased ninefold in the past six months.Number of malware modifications for Android OSMalware writers from China and Russia show the greatest interest in malicious programs for Android. Chinese malware writers have managed to create a botnet with 10,000 to 30,000 active devices and the total number of infected smartphones is in the hundreds of thousands.The botnet was created using the RootSmart backdoor, which has extensive functionality related to remotely controlling Android phones and tablets. RootSmart is distributed using a proven method: the malware writers have re-packed a legitimate program and uploaded it to the website of an unofficial Android application store that is very popular in China. As a result, people who downloaded the program to help them set up their phones also received a backdoor that made their devices part of the botnet.The scope of the RootSmart infection means that the attackers have been able to profit from the mobile-phone botnet. They chose the most popular method used by mobile cybercriminals: sending paid SMS messages to premium numbers. But why gain full control of the device if the bot’s main function is to send premium SMS messages? It’s simple: full control allows the attackers to hide the presence of malware on the phone over extended periods of time, letting them syphon money from each user’s account for longer.Important lessons can be learned from the story of the first large botnet made up of mobile devices.First, since updates of mobile operating systems are not released very often, attackers can keep using the same exploits for months, because they will work on most devices.Second, since installing antivirus software on mobile devices has not become common practice, many people use their devices without even suspecting that they have long been infected, allowing botmasters to keep the devices at their disposal.So far, the situation has not changed significantly, and it is very likely that we will hear of much larger mobile botnets than RootSmart this year.Another botnet to have attracted the attention of experts in Q1 was the zombie network built of Mac OS X computers.Kaspersky Lab detects the Trojan used to build the botnet as Trojan-Downloader.OSX.Flashfake. We published analyses of this malware last year, as well as this year.The first versions of Flashfake appeared last autumn. The developers of the malware took steps to ensure its presence was harder to detect (they made sure that the Trojan was not installed on computers with protection installed, programmed bots to disable updates of the built-in protection system Mac OS X Xprotect, etc.). Later, we saw that cybercriminals were experimenting with new ways of controlling botnets. For example, some Flashfake versions used Twitter accounts created by the cybercriminals as command servers.A bot’s main purpose is to download and launch additional modules without the user’s knowledge. The attackers made money by generating fake search-engine results: an additional module was designed to replace links in the results of popular search queries. The attackers can obviously use other modules, as well, e.g. to steal data from infected computers.In March 2012, Flashback infected about 700,000 computers across the globe.Geographical distribution of computers infected by Trojan-Downloader.OSX.FlashFake, Kaspersky Lab data, Q1 2012The attackers used a Java exploit to distribute the malware. Importantly, Oracle cannot update Java on Mac OS X computers automatically. Users have to wait for Apple to release an update, which sometimes takes several months. As a result, the time period during which cybercriminals can use an exploit to infect Macs is significantly longer than in the case of Windows. Apple only released the patch closing the vulnerability that was exploited to spread Flashback in early April, even though Oracle made its own patch available back in February.The number of attacks on Mac OS X machines based on exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities is set to grow. Most vulnerable applications that are popular among cybercriminals are cross-platform, i.e. they work both under Windows and under Mac OS X. This makes creating exploits for Mac OS X easier.The growing interest in the Apple platform on the part of cybercriminals is confirmed by Kaspersky Lab statistics on detections of new malware versions targeting Mac OS X:Number of new malware records for the Mac OS X platform added to Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus databasesThe main reason for the growth in the amount of malware targeting Mac OS X is the growing popularity of the platform among users. Although the number of malicious programs for Mac OS X is currently significantly smaller than that of malware for Windows, it is obvious that cybercriminals are seriously interested in the Mac platform. This means that users should take care to follow the basic security rules.This quarter, the story of Mac malware does not end with mass infections. We have discovered instances of malware for the platform being used in targeted attacks – another type of attack that is playing a significant role in today’s cybercriminal ecosystem.Unfortunately, the number of users falling victim to targeted attacks continues to grow. While companies are now taking the problem seriously, this is prompting cybercriminals to develop new attack vectors.Mac OS X + APT (advanced persistent threat)Many users of the Mac OS X platform still view it as absolutely safe, primarily because Apple has assured them for many years that the system is more secure than PCs. However, recent analysis has challenged that assertion. There are significant numbers of Mac users in corporate environments as well as in state organizations. Every day they work with lots of important documents, and in most cases their computers are not protected by an antivirus solution.Targeted attacks on organizations ought to serve as wake-up call for these users. Cybercriminals will attempt to gain access to secret documentation by simultaneously using two Trojans – one for Mac and another for Windows. The appropriate malicious program is loaded to the targeted computer depending on which operating system it is running. Both the Mac and Windows malware receive commands from the same C&C server.In order to penetrate the system in the first place, an exploit of the CVE-2011-3544 vulnerability in Java is used. This works just as well on a Mac OS X platform as it does on Windows. A successful attack saw Mac OS X systems infected with Backdoor.OSX.Lasyr. This backdoor allows cybercriminals to gain control of an infected machine and get access to all the information on the computer. It was detected in mid-March 2012.This was not the only case of targeted attacks using Mac malware in the first quarter of 2012. The second case involved only a backdoor for Mac OS X – Backdoor.OSX.MaControl. An exploit was also used to carry out the initial infection, but this time it targeted a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, which is popular on all platforms. The method of delivering the exploit was entirely conventional – it came in an email. To infect an employee’s computer with the backdoor, the .doc file attached to the message simply needed to be opened by the recipient.Malware for targeted attacks on Mac OS X platforms obviously isn’t difficult for cybercriminals to develop considering the speed with which the programs are appearing. The lack of concern shown by many Mac users about the risks, combined with the absence of anti-malware solutions on their computers, make Macintosh the weakest link in an organization’s security system.After a four-month break the authors of Duqu got back to work: in March a new driver was detected in the wild that was almost identical to previous Duqu drivers. The earlier drivers were created on 3 November 2010 and 17 October 2011, while the latest driver dates to 23 February 2012.The functionality of the new driver is consistent with that of previous versions. The code contains only minor modifications that were made to evade detection by antivirus programs. The main Duqu module associated with the driver was not detected.Our assumption that it won’t be that easy to shut down expensive projects like Duqu and Stuxnet turns out to be correct. Instead the cybercriminals have done what they always do – modified their code to evade detection and carried on with their attacks.With the help of the international community of developers and researchers, we managed to determine that the Duqu Framework was written in OO C. This approach would be typical for developers of “old school” programming working on serious projects, but it is almost never used in today’s malicious programs. This is yet more evidence that Duqu, along with Stuxnet, is a unique development that stands out from other malware.With fewer than 50 victims worldwide, Duqu remains the most mysterious Trojan ever detected. The fact that its targets are based in Iran suggests its authors have a definite plan for carrying out persistent attacks. The Trojan’s sophisticated and multi-layered protective measures underline just how important it is for this project to go unnoticed. It is quite possible that in future the Tilded platform will undergo further development to make the technology that masks and obfuscates code even more complex.Apart from new malware and major hacks (which we wrote about here and here), the first quarter of 2012 was also memorable for the successful joint actions of antivirus companies and law enforcement authorities. These partnerships took control over of the Hlux (Kelihos) botnet, took down the administration centers of several ZeuS botnets and arrested a gang of Russian cybercriminals.In late March 2012 Kaspersky Lab, in cooperation with CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, Dell SecureWorks and the Honeynet Project, took control of the peer-to-peer Hlux botnet based on the second variant of Hlux.b bot. At the time of the operation the botnet included over 110,000 bots.Distribution of computers infected by Hlux.b bot (according to Kaspersky Lab, Q1 2012)This is the second version of Hlux.b, which was detected in autumn 2011 several weeks after the first Hlux botnet was taken down. In spring 2012 a backup bot emerged much faster: the third version of the bot – Hlux.с – was detected several days after the botnet was taken over. All the new botnets modified the way their bots communicated with each other.In terms of profitability, Hlux is a model botnet for cybercriminals. Its hosts are involved in virtually all types of cybercrime: after loading different modules the bot is able to distribute spam, participate in DDoS attacks and steal critically important information from computers. The botnet hosts will not give up their cash cow without a fight, and until these cybercriminals are captured new versions of the bot will appear every time it is taken over.How effective is it to take over control of a botnet? From our perspective, this method is worth using. First, we disable the bots which are already installed, thus reducing the number of actively infected computers. Secondly, we make the life of cybercriminals much more difficult – they have to modify the code and distribute malware again, which is a costly business. Further takeover operations remain possible unless serious modifications are introduced into the botnet’s architecture.During the last three years Russia has seen the active development of Trojans targeting users of online banking systems.Detected malicious programs aimed at stealing data from online banking systemsIn Europe and Brazil cybercriminals mainly use banking Trojans to conduct attacks on home users. The characteristic feature of cybercriminals in Russia is that they actively develop malware aimed at stealing funds from the accounts of Russian businesses by manipulating Internet banking systems on accountants’ computers. Trojan-Spy.Win32.Carberp is one of the best-known examples of this type of Trojan.On 20 March, Department К of Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrests of several members of a major gang who used a pre-purchased version of Carberp Trojan to create a botnet. Several so-called mules – people who withdrew the stolen money – were also arrested. The suspects are believed to have stolen more than US$2 million. A large number of infected computers was required to steal such a large sum. Carberp was distributed via drive-by attacks: cybercriminals posted links to malicious resources on the websites of well-known Russian organizations, mass media and state services.This announcement was very welcome, particularly in Russia, where cybercriminals are rarely arrested. In most cases, such arrests prompt other cybercriminals to reduce their activities for a while. Unfortunately, the authors of the Carberp Trojan remain at large and it is still being sold on specialized forums and distributed via hacked websites. Nevertheless, we hope that the authors of Carberp will eventually face justice.Here we will discuss the statistics obtained from the work of different anti-malware components. The report is based on data collected by the Kaspersky Security Network. The statistics were acquired from those KSN users who consented to share their local data. Millions of users of Kaspersky Lab products in over 200 countries take part in the global information exchange on malicious activity.The statistics in this section are based on the web-antivirus solution that protects users as soon as malicious code is uploaded from an infected web page. Infections can be found on web pages where users are allowed to create their own content (e.g. forums) and even on legitimate pages which have subsequently been compromised by hackers.In the first quarter of 2012, 481,411,722 attacks from web resources located in different countries were neutralized. 95,331 unique modifications of malicious and potentially unwanted programs were detected in those incidents.*These statistics represent detection verdicts of the web-based antivirus module and were submitted by the users of Kaspersky Lab products who consented to share their local data.**The total number of unique incidents recorded by web-based antivirus on user computers.First in the rating are various malicious URLs (we previously detected them as Blocked) that are already on our denylist. Compared with the previous quarter these were down 2 percentage points to 84% of all detected problems. This list is principally filled with the websites that users are redirected to. Typically users get to these sites from hacked legitimate resources with embedded malicious scripts (a so-called drive-by attack). However, users can click on dangerous links all by themselves, for instance when looking for pirate software. Nowadays, though, the main guarantee of a successful Internet-based attack is the use of exploits targeting unpatched software: a significant proportion of malicious URL detections still come from websites related to exploit packs.12 programs in the Top 20 exploit software vulnerabilities and are used to deliver malware to users’ computers.Only three pieces of advertising malware – or adware – made it into the Top 20 in the first quarter of 2012. Their task is simple – after being installed on a computer (as a rule, in the guise of a browser expansion pack), they show advertisements. The amount of adware is appreciably less than in the previous quarter, when a third of the Top 20 was in this category. This indicates that cybercriminals have switched again to more harmful and more profitable categories of malware.Since the majority of attacks via the Internet are performed with exploits that target vulnerabilities in software to breach security and execute malicious code without the user’s knowledge, it is logical to ask which programs are usually targeted by exploits. It is strongly recommended to update these programs in the first instance, and subsequently set automatic updates in future.Applications with vulnerabilities targeted by online exploits in the first quarter of 2012According to the diagram, 66% of exploit-based attacks target just two programs – Adobe Reader and Java.Roughly one in four attacks on Java target the vulnerability CVE-2011-3544, which was popular among cybercriminals over the whole quarter: it was used for the distribution of the Hlux bot, the Carberp Trojan and a ‘fileless’ bot.In order to determine the geographical source of an attack, the domain name is compared to the actual IP address where the domain in question is located, and the geographical location of the IP address is determined (GEOIP).In the first quarter of 2012, 84% of web resources used for malware distribution were concentrated in 10 countries – 7 percentage points higher than in the previous quarter.Countries where web resources were seeded with malware in the first quarter of 2012A new country entered the Top 20 as Canada ousted Romania with 0.9%. The US, the Netherlands and Russia continue to lead the table. Over the last three months the percentage of dangerous hosts located in the UK went up 4.6 percentage points to 7%, resulting in a rise of two places from 8th to 6th. The percentage of other countries did not change significantly, with all fluctuations within a range of 1 percentage point.In order to assess the risk of infection to which computers are exposed in any given country, we have calculated the frequency at which antivirus programs on user computers detected threats for each country during the last quarter.20 Countries where users run the most serious risk of infection via the Internet**When calculating, we excluded those countries in which the number of Kaspersky Lab product users is relatively small (less than 10,000).**The percentage of unique users in the country with computers running Kaspersky Lab products that blocked web-borne threats.About half of the top 20 is comprised of former Soviet republics.The countries can also be broken down into different risk groups.The lowest Internet infection rates were recorded in Japan (14.3%), Denmark (15.2%), Taiwan (15.2%), Luxemburg (17.4%), Slovakia (19.6%) and New Zealand (20%).The risk of online infection around the world, Q1 2012On average 28.8% of the computers hooked up to KSN were subjected to an attack at least once while surfing the Internet during the first quarter. Extrapolating from those figures, it suggests that one in three computers worldwide faces frequent, active threats. However, there is some good news: the proportion of computers having to fend off attacks was down 3.2 percentage points compared with the previous quarter.This section contains analysis of statistics based on data obtained from the on-access scanner and scanning statistics for different disks including removable media (on-demand scanner).In the first quarter of 2012 our antivirus solutions successfully blocked 966,981,163 attempts at local infection on user computers participating in Kaspersky Security Network.In total, 481,592 unique modifications of malware and potentially unwanted programs attempting to launch on user computers were detected (on-access scanner).These statistics are compiled from the malware detection verdicts generated by the antivirus modules of users of Kaspersky Lab products who have agreed to submit their statistical data. * The number of individual users on whose computers the antivirus module detected these objects as a percentage of all individual users of Kaspersky Lab products on whose computers a malicious program was detected.At the top of the chart we see an assortment of malicious programs which were detected using ‘cloud’ technologies (35.56%). These technologies reinforce antivirus databases: when there is no signature or heuristic data to detect a specific piece of malware, an antivirus company’s cloud resources may already have data about the threat. In this case the detected object is marked as DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.In second place is the verdict provided by the heuristic analyzer during proactive detection of numerous malicious programs – Trojan.Win32.Generic (31.49%).Fifteenth place is occupied by Trojan.WinLNK.Runner.bl which is used to automatically launch and distribute exploits for Windows shortcuts. The first programs of this type emerged after Stuxnet was discovered and are still very popular with virus writers.Over the past year Kido held on firmly to third place. The first quarter of this year saw an interesting change: for the first time in four years Net-Worm.Win32.Kido dropped two positions and was outstripped by Virus.Win32.Sality and Trojan.Win32.Starter.yy. This shows that the main distribution method for Kido – via the MS08-067 vulnerability – is losing its effectiveness as more and more computers around the world update their systems. As long as file infectors (Virus) remain effective, they retain their position in the rankings, regardless of whether users update their OS.These figures show the average rate of PC infection in different countries.Computer infection levels by country ** We excluded from our calculations the countries where the number of KL users is relatively low (less than 10,000). Percentage of all local threats of user computers, compared to all unique users of KL products in the country.On average, at least one malicious file was detected on 42.2% computers of all KSN users in the world – either on the computer itself or on removable media connected to it.Bangladesh remains the most dangerous computing environment: the rate for this country is still increasing and is now at 96.8%. Our products detected and blocked malicious programs on almost every one of our users’ computers in the country.Local infection rates can also be categorized into separate categories. These categories tend to be more stable than those for web threats facing each country.The risk of local PC infection around the worldThe 10 countries where users faced the least risk of local infection via the Internet were:In the first quarter of 2012 a total of 34,825,675 vulnerable programs and files were detected on the computers of KSN users – an average of 9 different vulnerabilities on each affected computer.The Top 10 are listed in the table below.Gain access to sensitive dataManipulate data DoS attack*Percentage of all users on whose computers at least one vulnerability was detectedA vulnerability in Oracle’s Java was detected on one third of all vulnerable machines. Since the Java vulnerabilities served as the vector of some of the most notorious infections, including the Mac botnet and the spreading of the ‘fileless’ bot, users should update the component as soon as possible. If you do not use the Java virtual machine, it is a good idea to remove it from your computer.Our ranking features two Java vulnerabilities. Five positions are taken by Adobe products, including Flash and Shockwave players and Reader, a popular application for reading pdf documents. It is worth noting that dozens of exploits have been created for these programs in the past few years, most of which are publicly available. This is why it is essential for users to ensure that these programs are patched in time.Vendors of products with the Top 10 vulnerabilitiesAny of the Top 10 vulnerabilities can jeopardize a computer’s security, because they all allow cybercriminals to gain full control of the system using exploits. Of the ten vulnerabilities, four enable attackers to gain access to sensitive data on the computer and two also make it possible to bypass security systems and conduct DoS attacks on a machine where a vulnerable application is installed. Three vulnerabilities open the way for XSS attacks. The Top 10 also features vulnerabilities that enable attackers to manipulate data, gain important information about the system and perform spoofing (i.e., a cybercriminal can pass himself off as the owner of a user account on the computer).Distribution of Top 10 vulnerabilities by type of system impactThe beginning of 2012 was marked by a qualitative change in the botnet ecosystem. Botmasters, who had begun to feel overcrowded in the Windows world actively targeted the mobile and Mac OS segments. Unfortunately, few users realize that their smartphones are fully-functional computers which contain valuable data that may be of interest to cybercriminals. In the case of Mac OS X users, the situation is more complicated: first the operating system’s vendor insisted for a long time that no malware existed for the platform, and then they insisted that Macs were more secure than PCs.Mobile devices and Macs are very attractive to cybercriminals. In addition to limited competition in the segment, a large proportion of mobile devices and Macs operate without any security solutions installed on them. Over 5,000 malicious programs for Android were detected in Q1 2012, which is one third more than last quarter’s figure. Over 70 malicious programs for Mac OS X were detected over the same period, double the figure for Q4 2011. This year, the number of threats targeting home devices in these two segments is set to continue growing rapidly.One of the quarter’s most significant technological developments was the attack of the ‘fileless’ bot, which performed all of its functions in RAM without creating any files on the hard drive. This made detecting the malware more difficult. Although the bot remained on the computer only until the machine was rebooted, the fact that it was distributed via a banner network used by popular legitimate sites made repeated infections, and hence a large number of active bots, very likely. Kaspersky Lab acted quickly in cooperation with the banner network’s owner to curb the attack. Since this type of attack is impossible without using exploits, only timely patching combined with antivirus protection can help to secure computers against it.In the light of the above, the security of the iOS mobile platform remains an open issue. Apple enforces policies that make distributing malicious code via the App Store very difficult. On the other hand, developers cannot create solutions which provide effective protection against possible attacks. If cybercriminals attack mobile devices based on the tried and tested Windows scenario where drive-by attacks lead to exploits executing arbitrary code on the system, users will effectively be on their own to cope with any malware running on their devices. All the technical prerequisites for this scenario are currently in place.In our review of malware evolution in 2011, we wrote that cybercriminals would search for new ways to conduct targeted attacks. Unfortunately, this quickly turned out to be true: in the first quarter of 2012, malware for Mac OS X used in targeted attacks was detected. It is worth noting that in the first stage, the attackers used an exploit for the Java virtual machine, which can be installed on virtually any platform. The malware detected turned out to be backdoors, i.e., programs giving the attackers full access to infected Macs. Corporate Mac users, who are convinced that their computers are ‘beyond suspicion’ and who therefore do not have any security solutions installed on their computers, jeopardize the security of the entire corporate network. It is very likely that this year will see more targeted attacks on corporate networks conducted via Mac OS X.The joint efforts of law enforcement agencies and IT companies are yielding results. In the first quarter the C&C servers of several ZeuS botnets were taken down in the US and the Hlux.b botnet was taken over. Several groups and individuals were arrested, including the authors of mobile malware known as Foncy in France, several groups of cybercriminals behind Carberp banking Trojans in Russia, and the notorious hacker TinHole, as well as several hackers from the Anonymous group in Romania.These successes should have a sobering effect on cybercriminals. We expect the number of attacks on home users to gradually stabilize in the near future.","T1055 Process Injection,T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing","<s>[INST] Today, botnets are one of the principal technologies used by cybercriminals.

In this respect, 2011 was a relatively uneventful year and cybercriminals came up with nothing radically new.

Whenever a ‘fileless’ bot is used, it is very difficult to identify the computers that make up the botnet, since no new executable files appear on the hard drive and the cybercriminals perform all their actions on behalf of Java, which is a legitimate process. Although patching is effective against this and similar threats, some users fail to patch their systems on a timely basis. This means that we may yet come across similar malware in the future, though not on a mass scale: this is, after all, rather sophisticated.In our Q3 2011 report, we mentioned that malware developers for mobile devices had selected Android OS as their platform of choice. In Q1 2012, we detected over 5,000 (5,444) malicious programs for the platform. The total number of malicious programs targeting Android has increased ninefold in the past six months.Number of malware modifications for Android OSMalware writers from China and Russia show the greatest interest in malicious programs for Android. Chinese malware writers have managed to create a botnet with 10,000 to 30,000 active devices and the total number of infected smartphones is in the hundreds of thousands.The botnet was created using the RootSmart backdoor, which has extensive functionality related to remotely controlling Android phones and tablets. RootSmart is distributed using a proven method: the malware writers have re-packed a legitimate program and uploaded it to the website of an unofficial Android application store that is very popular in China. As a result, people who downloaded the program to help them set up their phones also received a backdoor that made their devices part of the botnet.The scope of the RootSmart infection means that the attackers have been able to profit from the mobile-phone botnet. They chose the most popular method used by mobile cybercriminals: sending paid SMS messages to premium numbers. But why gain full control of the device if the bot’s main function is to send premium SMS messages? It’s simple: full control allows the attackers to hide the presence of malware on the phone over extended periods of time, letting them syphon money from each user’s account for longer.Important lessons can be learned from the story of the first large botnet made up of mobile devices.First, since updates of mobile operating systems are not released very often, attackers can keep using the same exploits for months, because they will work on most devices.Second, since installing antivirus software on mobile devices has not become common practice, many people use their devices without even suspecting that they have long been infected, allowing botmasters to keep the devices at their disposal.So far, the situation has not changed significantly, and it is very likely that we will hear of much larger mobile botnets than RootSmart this year.Another botnet to have attracted the attention of experts in Q1 was the zombie network built of Mac OS X computers.Kaspersky Lab detects the Trojan used to build the botnet as Trojan-Downloader.OSX.Flashfake. We published analyses of this malware last year, as well as this year.The first versions of Flashfake appeared last autumn. The developers of the malware took steps to ensure its presence was harder to detect (they made sure that the Trojan was not installed on computers with protection installed, programmed bots to disable updates of the built-in protection system Mac OS X Xprotect, etc.). Later, we saw that cybercriminals were experimenting with new ways of controlling botnets. For example, some Flashfake versions used Twitter accounts created by the cybercriminals as command servers.A bot’s main purpose is to download and launch additional modules without the user’s knowledge. The attackers made money by generating fake search-engine results: an additional module was designed to replace links in the results of popular search queries. The attackers can obviously use other modules, as well, e.g. to steal data from infected computers.In March 2012, Flashback infected about 700,000 computers across the globe.Geographical distribution of computers infected by Trojan-Downloader.OSX.FlashFake, Kaspersky Lab data, Q1 2012The attackers used a Java exploit to distribute the malware. Importantly, Oracle cannot update Java on Mac OS X computers automatically. Users have to wait for Apple to release an update, which sometimes takes several months. As a result, the time period during which cybercriminals can use an exploit to infect Macs is significantly longer than in the case of Windows. Apple only released the patch closing the vulnerability that was exploited to spread Flashback in early April, even though Oracle made its own patch available back in February.The number of attacks on Mac OS X machines based on exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities is set to grow. Most vulnerable applications that are popular among cybercriminals are cross-platform, i.e. they work both under Windows and under Mac OS X. This makes creating exploits for Mac OS X easier.The growing interest in the Apple platform on the part of cybercriminals is confirmed by Kaspersky Lab statistics on detections of new malware versions targeting Mac OS X:Number of new malware records for the Mac OS X platform added to Kaspersky Lab’s antivirus databasesThe main reason for the growth in the amount of malware targeting Mac OS X is the growing popularity of the platform among users. Although the number of malicious programs for Mac OS X is currently significantly smaller than that of malware for Windows, it is obvious that cybercriminals are seriously interested in the Mac platform. This means that users should take care to follow the basic security rules.This quarter, the story of Mac malware does not end with mass infections. We have discovered instances of malware for the platform being used in targeted attacks – another type of attack that is playing a significant role in today’s cybercriminal ecosystem.Unfortunately, the number of users falling victim to targeted attacks continues to grow. While companies are now taking the problem seriously, this is prompting cybercriminals to develop new attack vectors.Mac OS X + APT (advanced persistent threat)Many users of the Mac OS X platform still view it as absolutely safe, primarily because Apple has assured them for many years that the system is more secure than PCs. However, recent analysis has challenged that assertion. There are significant numbers of Mac users in corporate environments as well as in state organizations. Every day they work with lots of important documents, and in most cases their computers are not protected by an antivirus solution.Targeted attacks on organizations ought to serve as wake-up call for these users. Cybercriminals will attempt to gain access to secret documentation by simultaneously using two Trojans – one for Mac and another for Windows. The appropriate malicious program is loaded to the targeted computer depending on which operating system it is running. Both the Mac and Windows malware receive commands from the same C&C server.In order to penetrate the system in the first place, an exploit of the CVE-2011-3544 vulnerability in Java is used. This works just as well on a Mac OS X platform as it does on Windows. A successful attack saw Mac OS X systems infected with Backdoor.OSX.Lasyr. This backdoor allows cybercriminals to gain control of an infected machine and get access to all the information on the computer. It was detected in mid-March 2012.This was not the only case of targeted attacks using Mac malware in the first quarter of 2012. The second case involved only a backdoor for Mac OS X – Backdoor.OSX.MaControl. An exploit was also used to carry out the initial infection, but this time it targeted a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, which is popular on all platforms. The method of delivering the exploit was entirely conventional – it came in an email. To infect an employee’s computer with the backdoor, the .doc file attached to the message simply needed to be opened by the recipient.Malware for targeted attacks on Mac OS X platforms obviously isn’t difficult for cybercriminals to develop considering the speed with which the programs are appearing. The lack of concern shown by many Mac users about the risks, combined with the absence of anti-malware solutions on their computers, make Macintosh the weakest link in an organization’s security system.After a four-month break the authors of Duqu got back to work: in March a new driver was detected in the wild that was almost identical to previous Duqu drivers. The earlier drivers were created on 3 November 2010 and 17 October 2011, while the latest driver dates to 23 February 2012.The functionality of the new driver is consistent with that of previous versions. The code contains only minor modifications that were made to evade detection by antivirus programs. The main Duqu module associated with the driver was not detected.Our assumption that it won’t be that easy to shut down expensive projects like Duqu and Stuxnet turns out to be correct. Instead the cybercriminals have done what they always do – modified their code to evade detection and carried on with their attacks.With the help of the international community of developers and researchers, we managed to determine that the Duqu Framework was written in OO C. This approach would be typical for developers of “old school” programming working on serious projects, but it is almost never used in today’s malicious programs. This is yet more evidence that Duqu, along with Stuxnet, is a unique development that stands out from other malware.With fewer than 50 victims worldwide, Duqu remains the most mysterious Trojan ever detected. The fact that its targets are based in Iran suggests its authors have a definite plan for carrying out persistent attacks. The Trojan’s sophisticated and multi-layered protective measures underline just how important it is for this project to go unnoticed. It is quite possible that in future the Tilded platform will undergo further development to make the technology that masks and obfuscates code even more complex.Apart from new malware and major hacks (which we wrote about here and here), the first quarter of 2012 was also memorable for the successful joint actions of antivirus companies and law enforcement authorities. These partnerships took control over of the Hlux (Kelihos) botnet, took down the administration centers of several ZeuS botnets and arrested a gang of Russian cybercriminals.In late March 2012 Kaspersky Lab, in cooperation with CrowdStrike Intelligence Team, Dell SecureWorks and the Honeynet Project, took control of the peer-to-peer Hlux botnet based on the second variant of Hlux.b bot. At the time of the operation the botnet included over 110,000 bots.Distribution of computers infected by Hlux.b bot (according to Kaspersky Lab, Q1 2012)This is the second version of Hlux.b, which was detected in autumn 2011 several weeks after the first Hlux botnet was taken down. In spring 2012 a backup bot emerged much faster: the third version of the bot – Hlux.с – was detected several days after the botnet was taken over. All the new botnets modified the way their bots communicated with each other.In terms of profitability, Hlux is a model botnet for cybercriminals. Its hosts are involved in virtually all types of cybercrime: after loading different modules the bot is able to distribute spam, participate in DDoS attacks and steal critically important information from computers. The botnet hosts will not give up their cash cow without a fight, and until these cybercriminals are captured new versions of the bot will appear every time it is taken over.How effective is it to take over control of a botnet? From our perspective, this method is worth using. First, we disable the bots which are already installed, thus reducing the number of actively infected computers. Secondly, we make the life of cybercriminals much more difficult – they have to modify the code and distribute malware again, which is a costly business. Further takeover operations remain possible unless serious modifications are introduced into the botnet’s architecture.During the last three years Russia has seen the active development of Trojans targeting users of online banking systems.Detected malicious programs aimed at stealing data from online banking systemsIn Europe and Brazil cybercriminals mainly use banking Trojans to conduct attacks on home users. The characteristic feature of cybercriminals in Russia is that they actively develop malware aimed at stealing funds from the accounts of Russian businesses by manipulating Internet banking systems on accountants’ computers. Trojan-Spy.Win32.Carberp is one of the best-known examples of this type of Trojan.On 20 March, Department К of Russia’s Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrests of several members of a major gang who used a pre-purchased version of Carberp Trojan to create a botnet. Several so-called mules – people who withdrew the stolen money – were also arrested. The suspects are believed to have stolen more than US$2 million. A large number of infected computers was required to steal such a large sum. Carberp was distributed via drive-by attacks: cybercriminals posted links to malicious resources on the websites of well-known Russian organizations, mass media and state services.This announcement was very welcome, particularly in Russia, where cybercriminals are rarely arrested. In most cases, such arrests prompt other cybercriminals to reduce their activities for a while. Unfortunately, the authors of the Carberp Trojan remain at large and it is still being sold on specialized forums and distributed via hacked websites. Nevertheless, we hope that the authors of Carberp will eventually face justice.Here we will discuss the statistics obtained from the work of different anti-malware components. The report is based on data collected by the Kaspersky Security Network. The statistics were acquired from those KSN users who consented to share their local data. Millions of users of Kaspersky Lab products in over 200 countries take part in the global information exchange on malicious activity.The statistics in this section are based on the web-antivirus solution that protects users as soon as malicious code is uploaded from an infected web page. Infections can be found on web pages where users are allowed to create their own content (e.g. forums) and even on legitimate pages which have subsequently been compromised by hackers.In the first quarter of 2012, 481,411,722 attacks from web resources located in different countries were neutralized. 95,331 unique modifications of malicious and potentially unwanted programs were detected in those incidents.*These statistics represent detection verdicts of the web-based antivirus module and were submitted by the users of Kaspersky Lab products who consented to share their local data.**The total number of unique incidents recorded by web-based antivirus on user computers.First in the rating are various malicious URLs (we previously detected them as Blocked) that are already on our denylist. Compared with the previous quarter these were down 2 percentage points to 84% of all detected problems. This list is principally filled with the websites that users are redirected to. Typically users get to these sites from hacked legitimate resources with embedded malicious scripts (a so-called drive-by attack). However, users can click on dangerous links all by themselves, for instance when looking for pirate software. Nowadays, though, the main guarantee of a successful Internet-based attack is the use of exploits targeting unpatched software: a significant proportion of malicious URL detections still come from websites related to exploit packs.12 programs in the Top 20 exploit software vulnerabilities and are used to deliver malware to users’ computers.Only three pieces of advertising malware – or adware – made it into the Top 20 in the first quarter of 2012. Their task is simple – after being installed on a computer (as a rule, in the guise of a browser expansion pack), they show advertisements. The amount of adware is appreciably less than in the previous quarter, when a third of the Top 20 was in this category. This indicates that cybercriminals have switched again to more harmful and more profitable categories of malware.Since the majority of attacks via the Internet are performed with exploits that target vulnerabilities in software to breach security and execute malicious code without the user’s knowledge, it is logical to ask which programs are usually targeted by exploits. It is strongly recommended to update these programs in the first instance, and subsequently set automatic updates in future.Applications with vulnerabilities targeted by online exploits in the first quarter of 2012According to the diagram, 66% of exploit-based attacks target just two programs – Adobe Reader and Java.Roughly one in four attacks on Java target the vulnerability CVE-2011-3544, which was popular among cybercriminals over the whole quarter: it was used for the distribution of the Hlux bot, the Carberp Trojan and a ‘fileless’ bot.In order to determine the geographical source of an attack, the domain name is compared to the actual IP address where the domain in question is located, and the geographical location of the IP address is determined (GEOIP).In the first quarter of 2012, 84% of web resources used for malware distribution were concentrated in 10 countries – 7 percentage points higher than in the previous quarter.Countries where web resources were seeded with malware in the first quarter of 2012A new country entered the Top 20 as Canada ousted Romania with 0.9%. The US, the Netherlands and Russia continue to lead the table. Over the last three months the percentage of dangerous hosts located in the UK went up 4.6 percentage points to 7%, resulting in a rise of two places from 8th to 6th. The percentage of other countries did not change significantly, with all fluctuations within a range of 1 percentage point.In order to assess the risk of infection to which computers are exposed in any given country, we have calculated the frequency at which antivirus programs on user computers detected threats for each country during the last quarter.20 Countries where users run the most serious risk of infection via the Internet**When calculating, we excluded those countries in which the number of Kaspersky Lab product users is relatively small (less than 10,000).**The percentage of unique users in the country with computers running Kaspersky Lab products that blocked web-borne threats.About half of the top 20 is comprised of former Soviet republics.The countries can also be broken down into different risk groups.The lowest Internet infection rates were recorded in Japan (14.3%), Denmark (15.2%), Taiwan (15.2%), Luxemburg (17.4%), Slovakia (19.6%) and New Zealand (20%).The risk of online infection around the world, Q1 2012On average 28.8% of the computers hooked up to KSN were subjected to an attack at least once while surfing the Internet during the first quarter. Extrapolating from those figures, it suggests that one in three computers worldwide faces frequent, active threats. However, there is some good news: the proportion of computers having to fend off attacks was down 3.2 percentage points compared with the previous quarter.This section contains analysis of statistics based on data obtained from the on-access scanner and scanning statistics for different disks including removable media (on-demand scanner).In the first quarter of 2012 our antivirus solutions successfully blocked 966,981,163 attempts at local infection on user computers participating in Kaspersky Security Network.In total, 481,592 unique modifications of malware and potentially unwanted programs attempting to launch on user computers were detected (on-access scanner).These statistics are compiled from the malware detection verdicts generated by the antivirus modules of users of Kaspersky Lab products who have agreed to submit their statistical data. * The number of individual users on whose computers the antivirus module detected these objects as a percentage of all individual users of Kaspersky Lab products on whose computers a malicious program was detected.At the top of the chart we see an assortment of malicious programs which were detected using ‘cloud’ technologies (35.56%). These technologies reinforce antivirus databases: when there is no signature or heuristic data to detect a specific piece of malware, an antivirus company’s cloud resources may already have data about the threat. In this case the detected object is marked as DangerousObject.Multi.Generic.In second place is the verdict provided by the heuristic analyzer during proactive detection of numerous malicious programs – Trojan.Win32.Generic (31.49%).Fifteenth place is occupied by Trojan.WinLNK.Runner.bl which is used to automatically launch and distribute exploits for Windows shortcuts. The first programs of this type emerged after Stuxnet was discovered and are still very popular with virus writers.Over the past year Kido held on firmly to third place. The first quarter of this year saw an interesting change: for the first time in four years Net-Worm.Win32.Kido dropped two positions and was outstripped by Virus.Win32.Sality and Trojan.Win32.Starter.yy. This shows that the main distribution method for Kido – via the MS08-067 vulnerability – is losing its effectiveness as more and more computers around the world update their systems. As long as file infectors (Virus) remain effective, they retain their position in the rankings, regardless of whether users update their OS.These figures show the average rate of PC infection in different countries.Computer infection levels by country ** We excluded from our calculations the countries where the number of KL users is relatively low (less than 10,000). Percentage of all local threats of user computers, compared to all unique users of KL products in the country.On average, at least one malicious file was detected on 42.2% computers of all KSN users in the world – either on the computer itself or on removable media connected to it.Bangladesh remains the most dangerous computing environment: the rate for this country is still increasing and is now at 96.8%. Our products detected and blocked malicious programs on almost every one of our users’ computers in the country.Local infection rates can also be categorized into separate categories. These categories tend to be more stable than those for web threats facing each country.The risk of local PC infection around the worldThe 10 countries where users faced the least risk of local infection via the Internet were:In the first quarter of 2012 a total of 34,825,675 vulnerable programs and files were detected on the computers of KSN users – an average of 9 different vulnerabilities on each affected computer.The Top 10 are listed in the table below.Gain access to sensitive dataManipulate data DoS attack*Percentage of all users on whose computers at least one vulnerability was detectedA vulnerability in Oracle’s Java was detected on one third of all vulnerable machines. Since the Java vulnerabilities served as the vector of some of the most notorious infections, including the Mac botnet and the spreading of the ‘fileless’ bot, users should update the component as soon as possible. If you do not use the Java virtual machine, it is a good idea to remove it from your computer.Our ranking features two Java vulnerabilities. Five positions are taken by Adobe products, including Flash and Shockwave players and Reader, a popular application for reading pdf documents. It is worth noting that dozens of exploits have been created for these programs in the past few years, most of which are publicly available. This is why it is essential for users to ensure that these programs are patched in time.Vendors of products with the Top 10 vulnerabilitiesAny of the Top 10 vulnerabilities can jeopardize a computer’s security, because they all allow cybercriminals to gain full control of the system using exploits. Of the ten vulnerabilities, four enable attackers to gain access to sensitive data on the computer and two also make it possible to bypass security systems and conduct DoS attacks on a machine where a vulnerable application is installed. Three vulnerabilities open the way for XSS attacks. The Top 10 also features vulnerabilities that enable attackers to manipulate data, gain important information about the system and perform spoofing (i.e., a cybercriminal can pass himself off as the owner of a user account on the computer).Distribution of Top 10 vulnerabilities by type of system impactThe beginning of 2012 was marked by a qualitative change in the botnet ecosystem. Botmasters, who had begun to feel overcrowded in the Windows world actively targeted the mobile and Mac OS segments. Unfortunately, few users realize that their smartphones are fully-functional computers which contain valuable data that may be of interest to cybercriminals. In the case of Mac OS X users, the situation is more complicated: first the operating system’s vendor insisted for a long time that no malware existed for the platform, and then they insisted that Macs were more secure than PCs.Mobile devices and Macs are very attractive to cybercriminals. In addition to limited competition in the segment, a large proportion of mobile devices and Macs operate without any security solutions installed on them. Over 5,000 malicious programs for Android were detected in Q1 2012, which is one third more than last quarter’s figure. Over 70 malicious programs for Mac OS X were detected over the same period, double the figure for Q4 2011. This year, the number of threats targeting home devices in these two segments is set to continue growing rapidly.One of the quarter’s most significant technological developments was the attack of the ‘fileless’ bot, which performed all of its functions in RAM without creating any files on the hard drive. This made detecting the malware more difficult. Although the bot remained on the computer only until the machine was rebooted, the fact that it was distributed via a banner network used by popular legitimate sites made repeated infections, and hence a large number of active bots, very likely. Kaspersky Lab acted quickly in cooperation with the banner network’s owner to curb the attack. Since this type of attack is impossible without using exploits, only timely patching combined with antivirus protection can help to secure computers against it.In the light of the above, the security of the iOS mobile platform remains an open issue. Apple enforces policies that make distributing malicious code via the App Store very difficult. On the other hand, developers cannot create solutions which provide effective protection against possible attacks. If cybercriminals attack mobile devices based on the tried and tested Windows scenario where drive-by attacks lead to exploits executing arbitrary code on the system, users will effectively be on their own to cope with any malware running on their devices. All the technical prerequisites for this scenario are currently in place.In our review of malware evolution in 2011, we wrote that cybercriminals would search for new ways to conduct targeted attacks. Unfortunately, this quickly turned out to be true: in the first quarter of 2012, malware for Mac OS X used in targeted attacks was detected. It is worth noting that in the first stage, the attackers used an exploit for the Java virtual machine, which can be installed on virtually any platform. The malware detected turned out to be backdoors, i.e., programs giving the attackers full access to infected Macs. Corporate Mac users, who are convinced that their computers are ‘beyond suspicion’ and who therefore do not have any security solutions installed on their computers, jeopardize the security of the entire corporate network. It is very likely that this year will see more targeted attacks on corporate networks conducted via Mac OS X.The joint efforts of law enforcement agencies and IT companies are yielding results. In the first quarter the C&C servers of several ZeuS botnets were taken down in the US and the Hlux.b botnet was taken over. Several groups and individuals were arrested, including the authors of mobile malware known as Foncy in France, several groups of cybercriminals behind Carberp banking Trojans in Russia, and the notorious hacker TinHole, as well as several hackers from the Anonymous group in Romania.These successes should have a sobering effect on cybercriminals. We expect the number of attacks on home users to gradually stabilize in the near future.

"Apple released a number of patches, including a security update for iOS 11, which is available today. iOS 11 is out today and along with a new look and feel on the iPad especially comes a handful of patches for the Apple mobile OS. Apple addressed eight CVEs in today’s iOS update, and 15 overall as it also updated Safari and the Xcode development framework. Two Webkit bugs, CVE-2017-7106 and CVE-2017-7089, were patched in iOS and Safari. CVE-2017-7089 is a universal cross-site scripting bug disclosed by Frans Rosen of Detectify and Anton Lopanitsyn of ONSEC. Apple said it addressed a logic issue in iOS’ handling of parent tabs. CVE-2017-7106, meanwhile, could be abused by an attacker allowing them to spoof the address bar. A user would need to be tricked into visiting a site hosting an exploit, Apple said. Apple also patched a similarly described bug in Safari for iOS and macOS, CVE-2017-7085, allowing an attacker to again spoof the address bar. Address bar spoofing allows an attacker to manipulate the browser and display a familiar URL to the user while they instead visit a site of the attacker’s choosing. Apple also patched an issue in iOS’ implementation of Exchange ActivSync where an attacker already on the network could erase an iPhone or iPad during Exchange setup. Apple said it patched CVE-2017-7088 by requiring TLS during setup. iOS’ MobileBackup was also patched, addressing a permissions issue that could allow the feature to perform an unencrypted backup despite established requirements mandating encrypted backups. Apple also patched denial-of-service vulnerabilities in Messages, Mail MessageUI and iBooks. In Messages, a crafted message could cause an iPhone or iPad to crash; Apple patched CVE-2017-7118 with improved validation. In Mail MessageUI, Apple patched a memory corruption flaw that could also crash a device if a malicious image is processed. Apple said that CVE-2017-7072 addresses multiple DoS issues in iBooks, each exploited through the parsing of maliciously crafted iBooks files. The Xcode update included patches for single vulnerabilities in Git and subversion, and five in Id64, all of which lead to arbitrary code execution. The Git and subversion bugs affect macOS Sierra 10.12.6 or later, and can be exploited through a maliciously crafted repository. The Id64 issues also affect macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Apple said it the five CVEs were memory corruption issues that could allow an attacker to run code through the parsing of a crafted Mach-O file. macOS uses this file format for native executables, libraries and objects. : Mobile Security Vulnerabilities","T1566 Phishing,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] Apple released a number of patches, including a security update for iOS 11, which is available today. iOS 11 is out today and along with a new look and feel on the iPad especially comes a handful of patches for the Apple mobile OS.

Apple said that CVE-2017-7072 addresses multiple DoS issues in iBooks, each exploited through the parsing of maliciously crafted iBooks files. The Xcode update included patches for single vulnerabilities in Git and subversion, and five in Id64, all of which lead to arbitrary code execution. The Git and subversion bugs affect macOS Sierra 10.12.6 or later, and can be exploited through a maliciously crafted repository. The Id64 issues also affect macOS Sierra 10.12.6. Apple said it the five CVEs were memory corruption issues that could allow an attacker to run code through the parsing of a crafted Mach-O file. macOS uses this file format for native executables, libraries and objects. : Mobile Security Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1566 Phishing,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service </s>"
"Researchers warn that CVE-2021-34484 can be exploited with a patch bypass for a bug originally addressed in August by Microsoft. A partially unpatched security bug in Windows that could allow local privilege escalation from a regular user to System remains unaddressed fully by Microsoft – but an unofficial micropatch from oPatch has hit the scene. The bug (CVE-2021-34484) was originally disclosed and patched as part of Microsoft’s August Patch Tuesday updates. At the time, it was categorized as an arbitrary directory-deletion issue that was considered low-priority because an attacker would need to locally log into the targeted computer to exploit it, which, in theory, would allow the adversary to delete file folders anyway. However, the security researcher who discovered it, Abdelhamid Naceri, soon uncovered that it could also be used for privilege escalation, which is a whole other ball of wax. System-level users have access to resources, databases and servers on other parts of the network. Abdelhamid also took a look at Microsoft’s original patch, subsequently finding a bypass for it via a simple tweak to the exploit code he had developed, essentially reverting it to zero-day status. CVE-2021-34484 bypass as 0dayhttps://t.co/W0gnYHxJ6B — Abdelhamid Naceri (@KLINIX5) October 22, 2021 “The vulnerability lies in the User Profile Service, specifically in the code responsible for creating a temporary user profile folder in case the user’s original profile folder is damaged or locked for some reason,” explained 0Patch’s Mitja Kolsek in a Thursday writeup . “Abdelhamid found that the process (executed as Local System) of copying folders and files from user’s original profile folder to the temporary one can be attacked with symbolic links to create attacker-writable folders in a system location from which a subsequently launched system process would load and execute attacker’s DLL.” Register now for our LIVE event! The exploit is straightforward: An attacker would create a specially crafted symbolic link (essentially, a shortcut link that points to a specific file or folder), then would need to save it in the temporary user profile folder (C:\\Users\\TEMP). Then, when the User Profile Service copies a folder from user’s original profile folder as described by Kolsek, the symbolic link will force it to create a folder containing a malicious library (DLL) payload somewhere else where the attacker would normally not have permissions to create one. “Microsoft, even though believing the vulnerability only allowed for deletion of an arbitrarily ‘symlinked’ folder, made a conceptually correct fix: it checked whether the destination folder under C:\\Users\\TEMP was a symbolic link, and aborted the operation if so,” explained Kolsek. “The incompleteness of this fix, as noticed by Abdelhamid, was in the fact that the symbolic link need not be in the upper-most folder (which Microsoft’s fix checked), but in any folder along the destination path.” The micropatch fixes this by extending the security check for symbolic links to the entire destination path by calling the “GetFinalPathNameByHandle” function. It should be noted that a workable exploit also requires attackers to be able to win a race condition (with unlimited attempts) since the system will be attempting to perform two operations (one malicious, one legitimate) at the same time. Also, even though Abdelhamid said that “it might be possible to [exploit] without knowing someone [else’s] password,” so far, having user credentials for the targeted computer remains an obstacle, Kolsek noted. The bug affects Windows 10 (both 32 and 64 bit), versions v21H1, v20H2, v2004 and v1909; and Windows Server 2019 64 bit.

"Kaspersky Lab researcher Sergey Lozhkin was able to turn a few simple hacks into extensive access inside a Moscow hospital network. TENERFIE, Spain – Sergey Lozhkin knows malware. Medical devices? Admittedly, not so much. That, however, was not an impediment to the Kaspersky Lab researcher in cracking the digital walls of a Moscow hospital and finding a shocking array of open doors on the network and weaknesses in medical devices and applications crucial not only to the privacy of patients, but also their physical well-being. Today at the Kaspersky Lab Security Analyst Summit, Lozhkin told a real-world tale of how relatively easy it is for a hacker to get onto a hospital network using available tools and having very little background in medical device security. “I have no information on medical equipment; I don’t know how it works,” he said. “I started the research just to learn something. It’s really scary. When we develop technology in software systems, engineers forget about IT security. It’s a problem not just with medical equipment, but in a lot of areas of the industry.” In the U.S., more attention is being paid to medical device security than ever. Couple that with privacy concerns that are regulated by HIPAA, and health care security is a hot-button issue. The same cannot be said for Russia, Lozhkin said, despite the same threats and weaknesses. Attacks against medical devices expose not only reams of patient data, including diagnoses and medicinal treatments, but access to MRI devices and management applications could lead to catastrophic results if they are reconfigured by an attacker wishing to do physical harm. Lozhkin said a major problem is that some of these devices not only suffer from traditional software vulnerabilities, but many are connected to the Internet and reachable via remote interfaces used by physicians during treatment. Lozhkin said he found thousands of hospital devices online using a Shodan search, including radiology apps, MRI devices and of course, webservers. One search result turned up a Moscow hospital run by a friend of Lozhkin’s; among the the results was a Siemens log-in portal for a CT scan machine guarded only by a default password. Lozhkin told his friend at the hospital about the situation, who agreed to an informal pen-test. Lozhkin wanted to attack the hospital the way a black hat would—without of course accessing patient data or manipulating devices—and he started by sitting outside the location and cracking the facility’s Wi-Fi. He said he was able to brute-force the Wi-Fi credentials, which he said were “configured badly with an easy password” Once on the network, additional weak security was evident immediately, starting with an XP machine still vulnerable to MS-08-067. “You can say I just hacked [lousy] Wi-Fi, so what?” Lozhkin said. “The guys who are creating software for medical devices should think about someone configuring [lousy] Wi-Fi access to the local network.” Once on the network, using available pen-testing tools, Lozhkin was able to find a control panel for a MRI machine that was not password protected, There was also access to a C Shell in the application. “You could do anything you wanted; add files, get a full list of patients, information on diagnoses, all on this device,” Lozhkin said. In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued cybersecurity guidelines for medical device manufacturers, with recommendations including the adoption of risk management programs and calls for provisions to be made accept and triage vulnerability disclosure. The relative maturity of software security in health care is relatively low, but there encouraging signs. Data from the most recent iteration of the BSIMM model shows some signs of improvement, but health care does lag behind more bleeding edge industries such as financial services.

"Source Boston keynoter Keren Elazari sounded a call to action for industry to extend an acceptance of hackers. BOSTON—More than ever, hackers are getting a welcoming embrace from law enforcement, governments and business. Bug bounties and vulnerability disclosure programs are becoming the norm across industry, and hackers are no longer universally viewed as a pariah. Simultaneously, however, groups such as the ShadowBrokers and rogue hacktivist operations are co-opting some of that acceptance when they leak dangerous tools or personal information, putting a dent in the hacker spirit of demonstrating a threat to force a solution. Keren Elazari, a security researcher at Tel Aviv University in Israel, today during a keynote at Source Boston likened white-hats to the immune system of the information age, and urged organizations to continue to embrace “the creative chaos” hackers bring. To a large degree, that’s happening already, she said, pointing to the Department of Defense’s Hack the Pentagon, Army and Air Force bug bounty programs as examples of hackers playing a bigger role in hardening defenses. She also said programs such as the Federal Trade Commission’s competition that solicited security solutions for connected devices and DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge represents a general recognition by lawmakers and boards of directors that awareness of threats and solutions are a mandate. But the ShadowBrokers’ leaks of NSA hacking tools, WikiLeaks spilling of CIA hacking tools and the relentless manipulation of the U.S. presidential election last year continue to threaten recent gains, Elazari said. “It breaks my heart when I see a manipulation of the truth taking place,” she said. “This is very far from what I saw a few years ago.” Bug bounties are probably the most tangible outreach organizations have toward security researchers. More and more, these programs are not limited to tech companies. Retail organizations, airlines, automakers and many others see the value of setting up a mechanism for receiving bug reports and eventually paying relatively short money for private vulnerability disclosures that result in patches. “Having a bounty means (boards) can show shareholders that the company went the extra mile to identify security risks the company is facing,” Elazari said, adding that some bug-hunters have made a career of joining bounty platforms such as Bugcrowd and HackerOne and getting reimbursement and recognition for their work. “Bounties have created an opportunity for people worldwide to work as a researcher and get paid legitimately by big companies, and sometimes get a job offer,” Elazari said. “That’s something that had never happened before on such a scale.” The U.S. government has also extended an olive branch to white-hats through the Hack the Pentagon/Army/Air Force programs, something that was also incomprehensible in years prior. Five years ago, there was no way the government would advocate researchers poking around public-facing websites looking for vulnerabilities without the threat of long-term incarceration. Today, early beta runs of the DoD bounty programs have paid out tens of thousands of dollars to researchers who have turned over more than 100 bugs collectively. “There is great value there,” Elazari said. “Companies are enjoying an increase in reputation and can promote themselves as having a more mature approach to cyber if they have a bug bounty. It makes a world of difference.” Going forward, Elazari said advocacy groups such as I Am the Cavalry and others are going to be crucial in bringing device manufacturers to the table and securing connected devices. The Mirai DDoS attacks of last October were the warning shot to industry to address IoT vulnerabilities, such as default passwords and exposed telnet connections. It was clear the industry needs to do more to protect IoT devices, such as build mechanisms to automatically update firmware on devices. “Mirai is what brought the reality that not only will DDOS attacks continue to be with us, but they can be supercharged with these connected devices and can be used to attack DNS and NTP, both technologies that no one really owns and that we all rely on,” Elzari said. “This should inform us as security professionals and civilians to demand better from manufacturers and from people who maintain basic internet protocols.” : Hacks IoT Vulnerabilities","T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] Source Boston keynoter Keren Elazari sounded a call to action for industry to extend an acceptance of hackers.

"Industrial control systems manufacturers are continuing to discover and provide fixes for the OpenSSL Heartbleed vulnerability. Unified Automation issued a security advisory warning that its OPC UA software developers kit (SDK) for Windows contains the OpenSSL cryptography library that is vulnerable to Heartbleed. Schneider Electric, another industrial control system (ICS) manufacturer, posted its own advisory with mitigation information for the same bug, which can be introduced by a third party component in its Wonderware Intelligence Security application. Heartbleed was disclosed on April 7; the vulnerability is a missing bounds check in the OpenSSL TLS Heartbeat extension that exposes 64 KB of memory with each response. Replaying the attack can eventually leak credentials, and some researchers have managed to grab private encryption keys. Unified Automation isn’t actually fixing anything here. In fact, the maker of industrial control and SCADA systems is merely noting that its Windows OPC UA SDK – under certain circumstances – can be vulnerable to the bug. By default, its C++ and ANSI-based developers kits do not have HTTPS implemented. However, these kits do contain the vulnerable OpenSSL encryption library if HTTPS is enabled. For users deploying HTTPS, United Automation recommends they replace the vulnerable OpenSSL library with a current version (1.01.g or later) in order to mitigate this problem. Schneider Electric on the other hand has worked with a third party to ship a fix for the Heartbleed vulnerability in its Wonderware Intelligence systems. While the most current version of those systems is not vulnerable and has already been fixed, the company explains in an advisory that a number of users – after applying a recent update – have reinstalled a third-party component known as Tableau Server. That component is vulnerable to OpenSSL’s Heartbleed flaw. Therefore, Schneider Electric and the makers of Tableau Server have worked together to mitigate the bug in their components. Operators running Tableau Server versions 8.0.6 through 8.0.9 and 8.1.0 through 8.1.5 will need to implement these patches in order to resolve the potentially serious bug. Digi and Siemens have implemented similar patches to remedy Heartbleed in their ICS equipment in recent weeks.

For users deploying HTTPS, United Automation recommends they replace the vulnerable OpenSSL library with a current version (1.01.g or later) in order to mitigate this problem. Schneider Electric on the other hand has worked with a third party to ship a fix for the Heartbleed vulnerability in its Wonderware Intelligence systems. While the most current version of those systems is not vulnerable and has already been fixed, the company explains in an advisory that a number of users – after applying a recent update – have reinstalled a third-party component known as Tableau Server. That component is vulnerable to OpenSSL’s Heartbleed flaw. Therefore, Schneider Electric and the makers of Tableau Server have worked together to mitigate the bug in their components. Operators running Tableau Server versions 8.0.6 through 8.0.9 and 8.1.0 through 8.1.5 will need to implement these patches in order to resolve the potentially serious bug. Digi and Siemens have implemented similar patches to remedy Heartbleed in their ICS equipment in recent weeks.

"A researcher has uncovered a pair of vulnerabilities in the Kaseya VSA IT management platform, including an open redirect that could be used to force users to visit an attacker-controlled sites. Kaseya VSA is a platform designed to handle a wide variety of IT management tasks, including audit, inventory, security, patch management, backup and recovery, and others. The company has customers in a umber of different industries and VSA is its flagship product. The CERT Division at Carnegie Mellon University said in a vulnerability bulletin that the vulnerabilities affect several versions of VSA, including R9.1, R9, R8, and version 7.0. Of the two vulnerabilities, the open redirect is the only one that ca be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker. “Kaseya VSA, versions V7.x, R8.x and R9.x, contain an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker may be able to leverage users’ trust in the domain to induce them to visit a site with malicious content,” the CERT bulletin says.

"Both vulnerabilities are use-after-free issues in Mozilla’s popular web browser. Mozilla has released an emergency update for its Firefox browser that addresses two critical security vulnerabilities that cybercriminals have actively exploited in the wild as zero days. Both are use-after-free bugs, which are memory-corruption issues that occur when an application continues to try to use a chunk of memory that was assigned to it, after said chunk was freed up for use by a different application. This kind of problem can lead to remote code execution (RCE), data corruption and system crashes. The first bug addressed by Mozilla, CVE-2022-26485, is a use-after-free problem in the browser’s XSLT parameter processing. XSLT parameters are used for creating stylesheets that are used to determine the look and feel of a website. “Removing an XSLT parameter during processing could have led to an exploitable use-after-free,” according to Mozilla’s advisory over the weekend. The second bug, CVE-2022-26486, is a use-after-free issue in the WebGPU IPC Framework. WebGPU is a web API that supports multimedia on webpages by employing a machine’s Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). It’s used to support gaming, video conferencing and 3D modeling, among other things. “An unexpected message in the WebGPU IPC framework could lead to a use-after-free and exploitable sandbox escape,” according to Mozilla. The company didn’t provide much in the way of technical details, presumably to make exploitation all the more difficult for bad actors. However, Paul Ducklin, senior technologist with Sophos, offered some notes. The first bug, he said, is being exploited in the wild for RCE, “implying that attackers with no existing privileges or accounts on your computer could trick you into running malware code of their choice simply by luring you to an innocent-looking but booby-trapped website.” The second is being used for sandbox escape, as noted by Mozilla. “This sort of security hole can typically be abused on its own (for example, to give an attacker access to files that are supposed to be off limits), or in combination with an RCE bug to allow implanted malware to escape from the security confines imposed by your browser, thus making an already bad situation even worse,” Ducklin noted in a Saturday overview.

"Researchers said they now believe the malware has infected twice the number of router brands than previously stated and that the malware packs a much deadlier punch. Researchers say the impact of the VPNFilter malware discovered last month is larger than originally reported. On Wednesday, Cisco Talos researchers said they now believe the malware has infected twice the number of router brands than previously stated. They added that VPNFilter also delivers a more potent punch than they originally thought, and have identified a previously unidentified malicious malware module. On May 23, Talos researchers first reported that Russian-speaking threat actors, with links to the BlackEnergy APT group, were behind the VPNFilter malware that infected 500,000 router brands (ranging from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link as well as small office network attached storage (NAS) devices). At the time, known malicious capabilities of VPNFilter included bricking the host device, executing shell commands for further manipulation, creating a ToR configuration for anonymous access to the device, or maliciously configuring the router’s proxy port and proxy URL to manipulate browsing sessions. In updated research, Cisco Talos said the range of targeted routers now includes those made by manufacturers ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Ubiquiti, UPVEL and ZTE, bringing the total number of router models targeted by VPNFilter adversaries to 75. “These new discoveries have shown us that the threat from VPNFilter continues to grow,” Talos wrote in a technical breakdown of the malware on Wednesday. A closer examination of VPNFilter also demonstrates that the malware has the capability to infect more than the targeted routers and NAS devices — and can traverse into the networks that those devices support. “If successful, the actor would be able to deploy any desired additional capability into the environment to support their goals, including rootkits, exfiltration capability and destructive malware,” researchers wrote. To boot, Talos said that it has found a new stage-three module capable of injecting malicious content into web traffic as it passes through targeted network devices. Researchers identified the module as “ssler,” or an “endpoint exploitation module — JavaScript injection.” “At the time of our initial posting, we did not have all of the information regarding the suspected stage-three modules. The new module allows the actor to deliver exploits to endpoints via a man-in-the-middle capability (e.g. they can intercept network traffic and inject malicious code into it without the user’s knowledge),” researchers wrote. An additional “dstr” (device destruction module) component to the malware was also identified, which is “used to render an infected device inoperable by deleting files necessary for normal operation,” researchers wrote. “It deletes all files and folders related to its own operation first before deleting the rest of the files on the system, possibly in an attempt to hide its presence during a forensic analysis.” Lastly, researchers discussed new insights into a stage-three packet-sniffer module that they said was targeting industrial control system traffic. The sniffer specifically singled out the SafeStream Gigabit Broadband VPN router TP-LINK R600VPN. “VPNFilter is still in full force, in the wild, infecting a broader set of devices than known previously, which makes it quite concerning still,” wrote Derek Manky, global security strategist with Fortinet FortiGuard Labs, in an email. “This is a good example of how even exposed campaigns can continue to move with velocity.” : Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Researchers said they now believe the malware has infected twice the number of router brands than previously stated and that the malware packs a much deadlier punch.

"Popular chat apps, including LINE, Slack, Twitter DMs and others, can also leak location data and share private info with third-party servers. UPDATE Link previews in popular chat apps on iOS and Android are a firehose of security and privacy issues, researchers have found. At risk are Facebook Messenger, LINE, Slack, Twitter Direct Messages, Zoom and many others. In the case of Instagram and LinkedIn, it’s even possible to execute remote code on the companies’ servers through the feature, according to an analysis. Link previews are standard in most chat apps, and they can be very useful. When a user sends a link through, it renders a short summary and a preview image in-line in the chat, so other users don’t have to click the link to see what it points to. Unfortunately, there’s a downside. According to independent researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk, the feature can leak IP addresses, expose links sent in end-to-end encrypted chats and has been caught “unnecessarily downloading gigabytes of data quietly in the background.” The issues go back to how the previews are generated, according to the researchers. There are three ways to do that: The sender can generate it; the receiver can generate it; or the server can generate it. The last two are problematic, with the server-generated version being the most concerning. “How does the app know what to show in the summary?” Bakry and Mysk explained. “It must somehow automatically open the link to know what’s inside. But is that safe? What if the link contains malware? Or what if the link leads to a very large file that you wouldn’t want the app to download and use up your data.” Sender-Generated Links If the sender generates the preview, the app will go and download what’s in the link, create a summary and a preview image of the website, and it will send this as an attachment along with the link. A typical link preview. Source: Google. “When the app on the receiving end gets the message, it’ll show the preview as it got from the sender without having to open the link at all,” explained the researchers, in a posting this week. “This way, the receiver would be protected from risk if the link is malicious.” iMessage, Signal (if the link preview option is turned on in settings), Viber and WhatsApp all follow this best-practice approach, they noted. But, there is a caveat when it comes to Viber. “If you send a link to a large file, your phone will automatically try to download the whole file even if it’s several gigabytes in size,” researchers noted. They added, “it’s also worth mentioning that even though Viber chats are end-to-end encrypted, tapping on a link will cause the app to forward that link to Viber servers for the purposes of fraud protection and personalized ads.” Receiver-Generated Links When the receiver generates the preview, it means that the app will open any link that’s sent to it, automatically, with no user interaction needed. “This one is bad,” said the researchers, noting that the process can leak location data. “Let’s briefly explain what happens when an app opens a link,” they wrote. “First, the app has to connect to the server that the link leads to and ask it for what’s in the link. This is referred to as a GET request. In order for the server to know where to send back the data, the app includes your phone’s IP address in the GET request.” They added, “If you’re using an app that follows this approach, all an attacker would have to do is send you a link to their own server where it can record your IP address. Your app will happily open the link even without you tapping on it, and now the attacker will know where you are [down to a city block].” A second issue is that a link could potentially point to a large video or archive file. “A buggy app might try to download the whole file, even if it’s gigabytes in size, causing it to use up your phone’s battery and data plan,” the researchers warned. Server-Generated Links Finally, in the third approach, the app sends the link to an external server and asks it to generate a preview, then the server will send the preview back to both the sender and receiver. While this avoids the IP address-leaking issue found in the receiver-generating scenario, it potentially exposes information to third parties, according to the researchers, and can allow for code execution if the link points to a malicious website with JavaScript. As far as data exposure, the server will need to make a copy (or at least a partial copy) of what’s in the link to generate the preview. “Say you were sending a private Dropbox link to someone, and you don’t want anyone else to see what’s in it,” researchers wrote. “The question becomes…are the servers downloading entire files, or only a small amount to show the preview? If they’re downloading entire files, do the servers keep a copy, and if so for how long? And are these copies stored securely, or can the people who run the servers access the copies?” Multiple apps use this approach for previewing links. But in testing, they vary widely in terms of how much data the servers downloaded, researchers said: Discord: Downloads up to 15 MB of any kind of file. Facebook Messenger: Downloads entire files if it’s a picture or a video, even files gigabytes in size. Google Hangouts: Downloads up to 20 MB of any kind of file. Instagram: Just like Facebook Messenger, but not limited to any kind of file. The servers will download anything no matter the size. LINE: Downloads up to 20 MB of any kind of file. LinkedIn: Downloads up to 50 MB of any kind of file. Slack: Downloads up to 50 MB of any kind of file. Twitter: Downloads up to 25 MB of any kind of file. Zoom: Downloads up to 30 MB of any kind of file. “Though most of the app servers we’ve tested put a limit on how much data gets downloaded, even a 15 MB limit still covers most files that would typically be shared through a link (most pictures and documents don’t exceed a few MBs in size),” the researchers noted. “So if these servers do keep copies, it would be a privacy nightmare if there’s ever a data breach of these servers.” The issue is of particular concern to LINE users, according to Bakry and Mysk, because LINE claims to have end-to-end encryption where only the sender and receiver can read the messages. “When the LINE app opens an encrypted message and finds a link, it sends that link to a LINE server to generate the preview,” according to the researchers. “We believe that this defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption, since LINE servers know all about the links that are being sent through the app, and who’s sharing which links to whom. Basically, if you’re building an end-to-end encrypted app, please don’t follow [the server-generated] approach.” After the researchers sent a report to the LINE security team, the company updated its FAQ to include a disclosure that they use external servers for preview links, along with information on how to disable them. Facebook Messenger and its sister app Instagram Direct Messages are the only ones in the testing that put no limit on how much data is downloaded to generate a link preview. Facebook responded to the researchers’ concerns, saying that it considers the feature to be working as intended, but did not confirm how long it holds onto the data. Twitter gave the same response. “As we explained to the researcher weeks ago, these are not security vulnerabilities,” a facebook company spokesperson told Threatpost. “The behavior described is how we show previews of a link on Messenger or how people can share a link on Instagram, and we don’t store that data. This is consistent with our data policy and terms of service.” Slack meanwhile confirmed that it only caches link previews for around 30 minutes, which is also explained in its documentation. Zoom told the researchers that it is looking into the issue and that it’s discussing ways to ensure user privacy. The researchers also contacted Discord, Google Hangouts and LinkedIn to report their findings, but said they have not received a response from these two. Remote Code-Execution Woes As far as the code-execution issue, the researchers posted a video with a proof-of-concept of how hackers can run any JavaScript code on Instagram servers. And in LinkedIn Messages case, the servers were also vulnerable to running JavaScript code, which allowed them to bypass the 50 MB download limit in a test. “You can’t trust code that may be found in all the random links that get shared in chats,” Bakry and Mysk explained. “We did find, however, at least two major apps that did this: Instagram and LinkedIn. We tested this by sending a link to a website on our server which contained JavaScript code that simply made a callback to our server. We were able to confirm that we had at least 20 seconds of execution time on these servers. It may not sound like much, and our code didn’t really do anything bad, but hackers can be creative.” When reached via Twitter DM, Mysk told Threatpost that “In our testing, an attacker can run any JavaScript code on these servers. While it may not be immediately obvious how this can cause real harm, allowing JavaScript code to run leaves the door wide open for a team of dedicated attackers. The simplest attack would be something like mining cryptocurrencies on these servers and using up their resources.” Neither company responded to the researchers’ concerns. But the Facebook spokesperson told Threatpost that the feature works as intended, and that it’s not a security vulnerability. The person added that way the functionality is presented does not take into account industry-standard security measures that Instagram has put in place to protect against code-execution risks, and that when the concern was reported, it “found no risk of RCE.” As for LinkedIn, a spokesperson told Threatpost via email: “To help keep our members safe, we use a sandbox environment to evaluate the security risk of the links being shared. These environments are ephemeral and have strict access controls that are designed to discover malicious code execution. To this end, we do execute JavaScript in the URL contents for completeness of evaluation. We also don’t cache the content of these URLs. All these steps are taken to inspect content of link for safety.” But Mysk noted that such protections may not be good enough. “Server-side mitigations such as running JavaScript code in a sandbox environment is effective in thwarting most attacks, but more sophisticated attacks could allow the attacker to leave the sandbox and execute code outside the protected environment, which could potentially allow the attacker to steal data and secret keys,” he told Threatpost. “We’ve seen many successful attempts to escape the JavaScript sandbox in apps like Chrome, and these link preview servers are no different.” Looking for Safety The link-preview issue is just one more concern when it comes to the security of the collaboration apps that have become intrinsic to the work-from-home reality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The good news is that some apps don’t render previews at all, such as Signal (if the link preview option is turned off in settings), Threema, TikTok and WeChat. “This is the safest way to handle links, since the app won’t do anything with the link unless you specifically tap on it,” researchers noted. However, they also warned that link previews are a widespread phenomenon: “There are many email apps, business apps, dating apps, games with built-in chat, and other kinds of apps that could be generating link previews improperly, and may be vulnerable to some of the problems we’ve covered.”","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion","<s>[INST] Popular chat apps, including LINE, Slack, Twitter DMs and others, can also leak location data and share private info with third-party servers.

Facebook Messenger and its sister app Instagram Direct Messages are the only ones in the testing that put no limit on how much data is downloaded to generate a link preview. Facebook responded to the researchers’ concerns, saying that it considers the feature to be working as intended, but did not confirm how long it holds onto the data. Twitter gave the same response. “As we explained to the researcher weeks ago, these are not security vulnerabilities,” a facebook company spokesperson told Threatpost. “The behavior described is how we show previews of a link on Messenger or how people can share a link on Instagram, and we don’t store that data. This is consistent with our data policy and terms of service.” Slack meanwhile confirmed that it only caches link previews for around 30 minutes, which is also explained in its documentation. Zoom told the researchers that it is looking into the issue and that it’s discussing ways to ensure user privacy. The researchers also contacted Discord, Google Hangouts and LinkedIn to report their findings, but said they have not received a response from these two. Remote Code-Execution Woes As far as the code-execution issue, the researchers posted a video with a proof-of-concept of how hackers can run any JavaScript code on Instagram servers. And in LinkedIn Messages case, the servers were also vulnerable to running JavaScript code, which allowed them to bypass the 50 MB download limit in a test. “You can’t trust code that may be found in all the random links that get shared in chats,” Bakry and Mysk explained. “We did find, however, at least two major apps that did this: Instagram and LinkedIn. We tested this by sending a link to a website on our server which contained JavaScript code that simply made a callback to our server. We were able to confirm that we had at least 20 seconds of execution time on these servers. It may not sound like much, and our code didn’t really do anything bad, but hackers can be creative.” When reached via Twitter DM, Mysk told Threatpost that “In our testing, an attacker can run any JavaScript code on these servers. While it may not be immediately obvious how this can cause real harm, allowing JavaScript code to run leaves the door wide open for a team of dedicated attackers. The simplest attack would be something like mining cryptocurrencies on these servers and using up their resources.” Neither company responded to the researchers’ concerns. But the Facebook spokesperson told Threatpost that the feature works as intended, and that it’s not a security vulnerability. The person added that way the functionality is presented does not take into account industry-standard security measures that Instagram has put in place to protect against code-execution risks, and that when the concern was reported, it “found no risk of RCE.” As for LinkedIn, a spokesperson told Threatpost via email: “To help keep our members safe, we use a sandbox environment to evaluate the security risk of the links being shared. These environments are ephemeral and have strict access controls that are designed to discover malicious code execution. To this end, we do execute JavaScript in the URL contents for completeness of evaluation. We also don’t cache the content of these URLs. All these steps are taken to inspect content of link for safety.” But Mysk noted that such protections may not be good enough. “Server-side mitigations such as running JavaScript code in a sandbox environment is effective in thwarting most attacks, but more sophisticated attacks could allow the attacker to leave the sandbox and execute code outside the protected environment, which could potentially allow the attacker to steal data and secret keys,” he told Threatpost. “We’ve seen many successful attempts to escape the JavaScript sandbox in apps like Chrome, and these link preview servers are no different.” Looking for Safety The link-preview issue is just one more concern when it comes to the security of the collaboration apps that have become intrinsic to the work-from-home reality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The good news is that some apps don’t render previews at all, such as Signal (if the link preview option is turned off in settings), Threema, TikTok and WeChat. “This is the safest way to handle links, since the app won’t do anything with the link unless you specifically tap on it,” researchers noted. However, they also warned that link previews are a widespread phenomenon: “There are many email apps, business apps, dating apps, games with built-in chat, and other kinds of apps that could be generating link previews improperly, and may be vulnerable to some of the problems we’ve covered.” [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion </s>"
"Researchers found three vulnerabilities in Foscam connected security cameras that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera’s IP address. Foscam  is urging customers to update their security cameras after researchers found three vulnerabilities in that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera’s IP address. The vulnerability trifecta includes an arbitrary file-deletion bug, a shell command-injection flaw and a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability according to the researchers at VDOO who found the flaws. “To the best of our knowledge, these vulnerabilities were not exploited in the field, and therefore, did not lead to any concrete privacy violation or security threat to Foscam customers,” researchers said in a post last week. “The Foscam team acted promptly to patch these vulnerabilities and push them to the vulnerable products.” The proof-of-concept attack revolved around a process in the cameras called webService, which receives requests from servers and can be used to verify the user’s credentials, if necessary, and run the handler for the desired API command. To launch an attack, an attacker would have to obtain the camera’s IP address or DNS name. Generally if the camera is configured so that it has direct interface to the internet, its address might be exposed to certain internet scanners. The PoC attacker then crashed the webService process by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2018-6832). After it crashes, the webService process automatically restarts via the watchdog daemon (which restarts important processes after they’re terminated), and during the process reload, an attacker could leverage a second flaw, the arbitrary file-deletion vulnerability (CVE-2018-6830), to delete certain critical files. This will result in authentication bypass when the webService process reloads; so that the bad actor is able to gain administrative credentials. From there, an attacker could use the third vuln (CVE-2018-6831) to execute root commands. This bug is a shell command-injection vulnerability that requires administrator credentials. “Since the adversary gained administrator credentials in the previous stage, he can now use this vulnerability to execute commands as the root user for privilege escalation,” researchers said. The Internet of Things continues to post a significant problem as many connected devices lack proper security controls. The 2016 Mirai botnet attack,  which was orchestrated as a distributed denial of service attack through 300,000 vulnerable IoT  devices like webcams, routers and video recorders, showed just how big of an impact the lack of IoT security has. The patches also come after reports of a hacked baby camera emerged last week, when a woman from South Carolina said a stranger hacked into her baby monitor to spy on her and her family. These IoT security incidents show not only that connected products are highly vulnerable to security hacks, but also that such hacks could mean a complete invasion of privacy at the most personal level. Researchers at VDOO said that they found an array of bad architectural practices in the cameras that are indicative of mistakes that other IoT product manufacturers are making. These mistakes  make it easier for an attacker to discover and exploit vulnerabilities, including root processes and bad input sanitization. “All the device’s processes run as root. This violates the concept of privilege separation … which states that a program should be divided into parts – each part limited to its own needed privileges,” researchers said. “While every process in the system runs as root – a code-execution bug in any of the system’s processes will allow the attacker to escalate to root privileges.” Foscam, for its part, urged customers to upgrade their cameras as soon as possible, saying that “the latest firmware for Foscam cameras utilizes protection against various types of online hacking and unauthorized access.” It added, “Foscam is fully committed to maintaining the safety and integrity of our user experience and will take all action reasonably necessary to ensure the privacy and security of our cameras.”   : IoT Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Researchers found three vulnerabilities in Foscam connected security cameras that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera’s IP address.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes We’ve all been there: You’re doing research online and download a new program onto your computer. Suddenly a pop-up on the bottom of your desktop informs you something may be wrong. The antivirus program you’re running has flagged the newly-downloaded file as something suspicious, and you’re left deciding whether to trust the source of the file or not. At this point, most people are left with one of two options: delete the file and move on, or roll the dice, run the program, and hope for the best. Unfortunately, neither option is ideal when trying to maximize productivity levels or keep a network healthy and sustainable.  But what is the alternative solution? How can individuals ensure their programs are safe to use without potentially compromising their systems? The answer is auto-containment. What is Auto-Containment? Auto-containment is the action of taking something potentially harmful and moving it to an isolated setting where it can be tested and investigated further. In cybersecurity, this is known as “sandboxing” and allows users to view unknown files or run suspicious programs in a restricted operating system environment without compromising the integrity of their primary system.  The effectiveness of auto-containment can be likened to this: Let’s say you’re going for a walk outside, and you recognize a familiar face. You spend a bit of time chatting with the person, but after a while, the individual requests to come and visit your home. The problem is, however, that while you know who this person is, you’re not too sure if you trust them enough to walk them into your house. But no one wants to be rude, so you invite them over. What the individual doesn’t realize though is that the “house” you invited them into isn’t your home at all. Instead, you’ve staged a heavily surveilled building to look and feel just like a home, but in reality, it’s designed to monitor and watch every move the person makes. All the visible valuables in the building are actually worthless props, and you’ve positioned yourself behind an invisible, impenetrable pane of glass while you observe all of their actions. Here, you’ve killed two birds with one stone. In the event the individual had ulterior motives and tried to attack you or steal any of your “valuables,” you can smile and wave without a worry in the world. On the other hand, if the individual is sincere about their motives, you’re able to establish a relationship and can trust them moving forward. Now, as somewhat unrealistic as this illustration may be, in cybersecurity situations, auto-containment works just like this. However, it’s important to note that not all antivirus and internet security options operate this way. In fact, many security software solutions focus on identifying suspicious activities and leaving it to the user to discern the credibility of files without providing an isolated environment to test. Many users need a better solution.  Auto-Containment Analysis Using Comodo Valkyrie Comodo Valkyrie is a cloud-based verdict system that inspects and analyzes the run-time behavior of unknown files in a safe sandbox environment. Valkyrie analyzes over 200 million file queries per day and more than 300 million unknown files each year. Comodo’s Auto Containment technology is also extremely lightweight, only utilizing 2% computer processing resources and just 20 megabytes of RAM. By using a CPU-enforced OS virtualization model, Comodo’s Auto Containment technology significantly improves on performance issues typically found in most sandboxes and containers. Valkyrie is managed through a self-serve console that allows users to upload suspicious files for analysis. Valkyrie’s system uses multiple techniques for analysis, including automated signature-based detection and human experts to provide comprehensive reporting of file statuses.  Valkyrie’s file verification service utilizes embedded detectors to run an in-depth analysis of the entire run time of a file. Unlike traditional antivirus programs that only measure files surface-deep, Valkyrie uses both static and dynamic analysis to look deeper than the surface of a file, discovering potentially dangerous hidden images and coding that other programs may miss. All of this testing is managed through a safe sandboxed environment separate from your business systems and provides you with end-to-end security protection that grows with your business.

"The impending demise of Adobe Flash will create legacy challenges similar to Windows XP as companies begin to wean themselves off the vulnerable code base. Few times have there been technologies so reviled and celebrated at the same time as Adobe Flash. Since its introduction as Macromedia Flash Player in the mid-’90s, the technology has helped shape what the web has become today. At the same time, few internet technologies have united so many wanting to kick it to the curb. In 2020, in collaboration with Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Mozilla, Adobe will retire the much maligned Flash Player. A large part of the problem, experts say, despite progress in hardening its attack surface, is that it’s not secure enough. Flash continues to be a massive attack target that needs to go, they said. Since 2005, it has amassed 1,033 unique CVE entries, above, more than Microsoft’s Windows XP or Internet Explorer, according to CVEDetails.com. “Given the sheer amount of time I’ve focused on Flash, I might get a little teary eyed when it’s finally gone,” said Jasiel Spelman, a senior vulnerability researcher with Zero Day Initiative. Replacing it will be open standards such as HTML5, WebGL and WebAssembly. “These browser-based alternatives to Flash offer the same capabilities and functionalities. The trend is less helper apps and modern browsers with built-in capabilities that match those plugins of yesteryear,” Spelman said. Gateway to Exploits, Malware For more than a decade, the ubiquitous Flash Player has been a favorite target for attacks that attempted to trick users via a browser pop-up to install and run a bogus Flash Player that actually installed malware. Flash has been also abused by hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the legitimate Flash Player to run malware. Its appeal has been that a single Flash exploit could target multiple browsers, since most of them were running the program. Adobe Flash Player has offered hackers endless fertile ground for use in exploit kits, phishing schemes, zero-day attacks and backdoor programs, said Steve McGregory, research director at security firm Ixia. Most of those attacks lead to remote code execution because of a litany of vulnerabilities in legacy code leading to buffer overflows, or memory corruption issues. Its trail of carnage has included terabytes of lost intellectual property and industrial secrets, along with stolen passwords and credit card numbers. For those reasons, technology leaders such as Alex Stamos, chief security officer for Facebook, declared in a 2015 tweet that has since been deleted: “It is time for Adobe to announce the end-of-life date for Flash and to ask the browsers to set killbits on the same day.” Add to that Steve Jobs’ famous trashing of Flash in a longwinded 2010 manifesto explaining why Apple wouldn’t support it and arguing it should cease to exist. “Adobe Flash has been heavily leveraged in advertising, media and eLearning spaces, but unfortunately Adobe has not kept pace with the necessary security updates in order to outweigh the benefits of using the product,” said Mark Butler, CISO for Qualys. “If Flash wasn’t good enough for Steve Jobs to include in iOS software, it definitely shouldn’t be OK for us to use now. Flash has only increased in vulnerabilities since that time, and its patching cycles have lengthened,” he said. Transition Challenge Today, Adobe Flash security holes still dominate the threat landscape. So far this year there have been 60 unique CVEs associated with Flash, 53 rated high-severity allowing attackers to remotely execute code. Earlier this month Adobe patched a serious a local sandbox escape bug in its Flash Player after researchers failed to fix the bug completely in a previous patch. However, despite indicators pointing to a swift death and depreciation of Flash over the next three years, the transition could present challenges for companies. Experts say dependence on Adobe Flash will create legacy issues similar to those of Windows XP. “This is just the first step, once Flash is retired, we will all be facing the reality of older versions of Flash installed and being used without any security update support similar to what we have with Microsoft Windows XP. We all still have more work to do to make the retirement not just effective but safe,” said Christopher Budd, senior threat communications manager, Unit 42, Palo Alto Networks. Percentage of users who have encountered at least one page w/ Flash Player content in a day. Courtesy Chromium.org Three years ago, 80 percent of desktop Chrome users visited a site with Flash each day. Today usage is only 17 percent and continues to decline, according to Chromium, the open-source web browser project founded by Google. Budd said the biggest issue with Flash after 2020 is the risk of security vulnerabilities affecting Flash with no patches available for those issues. Zero Day Initiative’s Spelman says about 75 percent of the enterprise companies he works with are still dependent on Flash in some way. “We tell everyone that currently hosts Flash content that they should heed the guidance from Adobe and look to migrate to supported solutions. However, a number of those organizations have legacy Flash applications that can’t be disabled immediately because of dependency issues,” he said. Enterprises’ Flash Problems Won’t Subside There are no hard numbers on Flash usage inside and outside the enterprise. But, security experts say there are many firms that are using custom-built Flash applications that will be expensive to replace after the 2020 depreciation deadline. “Similar to Windows XP end-of-life, there is going to be a time when there are Flash ‘forever day’ [vulnerabilities] that will be known, but just never patched by Adobe,” Spelman said. Those companies are going to have to redevelop those apps from scratch. “It’s going to take time and convincing them that finding a Flash replacement is a cheaper alternative to a security breach.”  For its part, Adobe stated in July it will “continue to support Flash on a number of major OSes and browsers that currently support Flash content through the planned EOL (end of life). This will include issuing regular security patches, maintaining OS and browser compatibility and adding features and capabilities as needed.” In 2015, Adobe began the process when it announced that it had renamed Flash Professional CC to Animate CC and deemed it Adobe’s preferred tool for developing HTML5 content. In the meantime, developer Juha Lindstedt reacted to Adobe’s end of life verdict for Flash and turned to GitHub to petition users there to save Adobe Flash. His goal is to convince Adobe to turnover its Flash code to the open-source community. In his petition, Lindstedt calls Flash “an important piece of internet history and killing Flash means future generations can’t access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.” The petition has received mixed reviews within the software development and security communities. While some see Flash as bloated insecure code that needs to go away fast, others see handing it over to the open source community as a way to make it more secure and ensure that any legacy instances of Flash—after it sunsets—can be addressed with an emergency patch. So far Lindstedt’s petition has garnered 6,650 digital signatures.   “I think it would be a great idea. Flash is already partially open source,” Spelman said. “From a preservation point of view, I think it would be important to save a snapshot of what the internet looked like when Flash was around.” Adobe declined to comment for this story with the exception of stating it had no intention to make Adobe Flash open source. “I can tell you we don’t have any plans to do that at this time,” according to an Adobe spokesperson. : Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] The impending demise of Adobe Flash will create legacy challenges similar to Windows XP as companies begin to wean themselves off the vulnerable code base.

This will include issuing regular security patches, maintaining OS and browser compatibility and adding features and capabilities as needed.” In 2015, Adobe began the process when it announced that it had renamed Flash Professional CC to Animate CC and deemed it Adobe’s preferred tool for developing HTML5 content. In the meantime, developer Juha Lindstedt reacted to Adobe’s end of life verdict for Flash and turned to GitHub to petition users there to save Adobe Flash. His goal is to convince Adobe to turnover its Flash code to the open-source community. In his petition, Lindstedt calls Flash “an important piece of internet history and killing Flash means future generations can’t access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.” The petition has received mixed reviews within the software development and security communities. While some see Flash as bloated insecure code that needs to go away fast, others see handing it over to the open source community as a way to make it more secure and ensure that any legacy instances of Flash—after it sunsets—can be addressed with an emergency patch. So far Lindstedt’s petition has garnered 6,650 digital signatures.   “I think it would be a great idea. Flash is already partially open source,” Spelman said. “From a preservation point of view, I think it would be important to save a snapshot of what the internet looked like when Flash was around.” Adobe declined to comment for this story with the exception of stating it had no intention to make Adobe Flash open source. “I can tell you we don’t have any plans to do that at this time,” according to an Adobe spokesperson. : Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information </s>"
"Four different research teams cracked four different products on Wednesday–Adobe Flash, Reader, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer—and collectively earned a payout of $317,000 on the first day of Pwn2Own 2015. Four different research teams on Wednesday cracked four products–Adobe Flash, Reader, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer—and collectively earned a payout of $317,000 on the first day of Pwn2Own 2015. The annual hacking contest, which kicked off Wednesday in Vancouver, runs concurrently with CanSecWest and is hosted by HP’s Zero Day Initiative and Google’s Project Zero. The group of Chinese hackers that took down Flash last year, KeenTeam, targeted Flash once again yesterday. Alongside Zeguang Zhao, a researcher working under the guise of Team509, KeenTeam’s Peter Hlavaty, Jihui Lu, and Wu Shi exploited Flash running on a 64-bit Windows machine by using a heap overflow vulnerability, then used a local privilege escalation bug in the Windows kernel via TrueType fonts to bypass its defensive measures. The four researchers earned $60,000 for the Flash hack, which took all of 30 seconds, and an extra $25,000 for the escalation bug. Nicolas Joly, formerly of the French exploit vendor Vupen, took down Flash with a use-after-free vulnerability and a sandbox escape directory traversal vulnerability, but since Joly’s name was picked after Keen Team’s and Team 509’s, which had already broken Flash, his vulnerability paid only $30,000. Joly, right, followed his Flash attack by breaking Reader three times, once with an info leak vulnerability, again with remote code execution, and a third time by leveraging an integer overflow to exploit the broker, which earned him an additional $60,000.   KeenTeam also collaborated with Jun Mao, working with Tencent PC Manager, to take down Adobe Reader. KeenTeam’s Lu and Mao bypassed the software’s PDF security protections with an integer overflow bug, and later achieved pool corruption by disrupting kernel mode memory with another TrueType font vulnerability. The Reader bug was worth $30,000 since Joly had already broken Reader earlier in the competition, but the second bug, which gave them system access, earned the researchers an additional $25,000. Flash, Reader, Firefox, IE all fall at #Pwn2Own #CanSecWest via @Threatpost Tweet Mariusz Młyński, a security researcher from Poland who used two vulnerabilities to gain privilege escalation in Firefox 27 last year, targeted the browser again this year. Młyński earned $55,000 for digging up two bugs, a cross-origin vulnerability that eventually led to privilege escalation, all within the span of .542 seconds. According to HP Security Research’s Dustin Childs there was a fundamental Windows flaw that figured into Młyński’s Firefox hack and that Microsoft has been notified of the vulnerability. Microsoft wasn’t left out of the party. A new entrant in the competition, JungHoon Lee, working with 360Vulcan Team, broke a 64-bit version of Internet Explorer 11 with an uninitialized memory vulnerability to earn $32,500.

"Patched just last week, the Windows kernel bug is being used for full system takeover. A just-patched vulnerability in the Windows operating system that was previously unknown up until last week is being actively exploited in the wild; it opens the door for full system takeover. Discovered by Vasily Berdnikov and Boris Larin of Kaspersky Lab on St. Patrick’s Day this year, the flaw (CVE-2019-0859) is a use-after-free issue in the Windows kernel that allows local privilege escalation (LPE). It’s being used in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns, the researchers said, targeting 64-bit versions of Windows (from Windows 7 to older builds of Windows 10). The attackers are using the bug to establish persistent backdoors to targeted machines, gaining the ability to run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Fortunately, there’s a patch, which Microsoft pushed out in the most recent Patch Tuesday last week, so users should update their systems as soon as possible. Improper Handling of Objects in Memory In the win32k.sys kernel, the Function ID field is used to define the class of a window, such as “ScrollBar,” “Menu,” “Desktop” and others. The bug allows an attacker to manipulate the process of creating a window by sending specially crafted data sets to the Function ID field. “During execution, CreateWindowEx sends the message WM_NCCREATE to the window when it’s first created,” the researchers said in an analysis on Monday. “By using the SetWindowsHookEx function, it is possible to set a custom callback that can handle the WM_NCCREATE message right before calling the window procedure.” During that WM_NCCREATE callback, the Function ID is set to 0, which allows an adversary to set extra data for the window. “More importantly, we were able to change the address for the window procedure that was executed immediately after our hook,” researchers said. “The change of window procedure to the menu window procedure leads to the execution of xxxMenuWindowProc and the function initiates Function ID to FNID_MENU because the current message is equal to WM_NCCREATE. But the most important part is that the ability to manipulate extra data prior to setting Function ID to FNID_MENU can force the xxxMenuWindowProc function to stop initialization of the menu and return FALSE.” Because of that, sending of the NCCREATE message will be considered a failed operation, so the MENU-class window is not actually initialized, which allows an attacker to gain control over the address of freed-up memory block. Exploitation An attacker (who would need to already be logged into the system) can run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability. In the observed attacks, a malicious executable makes use of the legitimate PowerShell framework with a Base64-encoded command, which then fetches a second-stage PowerShell script from a Pastebin site. That in turn executes a third and final stage, also a PowerShell script, which unpacks lightweight shellcode. “The main goal of the shellcode is to make a trivial HTTP reverse shell,” the researchers explained. “This helps the attacker gain full control over the victim’s system.” The use of PowerShell, which is built into Windows, along with simple encoding techniques, helps obfuscate malicious activity and keep anti-virus detections at bay. Threatpost has reached out to Kaspersky Lab for additional details on the victimology of the campaigns. “At this time we don’t have any information at that time regarding the target,” the firm told Threatpost. “We have not seen activity of this group before and our researchers are currently investigating this attack to restore full kill chain. As soon as we will find the initial vector of attack we will share this information.” This is the fifth consecutive exploited LPE zero-day vulnerability discovered in Windows recently. The others are CVE-2018-8453, CVE-2018-8589, CVE-2018-8611 (a zero-day in the Windows Kernel Transaction Manager) and the CVE-2019-0797 “fourth horseman” vulnerability. The latter was seen being exploited in the wild by at least two threat actors, including a recently discovered APT group dubbed SandCat, and the FruityArmor group. Don’t miss our free Threatpost webinar, “Data Security in the Cloud,” on April 24 at 2 p.m. ET. A panel of experts will join Threatpost senior editor Tara Seals to discuss how to lock down data when the traditional network perimeter is no longer in place.

"The Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability can be exploited over wireless networks, according to a researcher who released PoC code for attacks against wireless authentication programs hostapd and wpa_supplicant. Regardless that the fervor over the Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability has died down considerably, patching the bug should remain a top priority for enterprises because researchers continue to find new exploit vectors. The latest takes aim at Heartbleed over wireless networks. A researcher with Portugal-based consultancy Sysvalue has shared details of attacks he calls Cupid in which he has built patches that modify hostapd and wpa-supplicant, two programs that act as wireless access and authentication management points. Hostapd, for example, sets up a configurable access point; it’s supported on Linux. Hackers could create a wireless network configuration of their choosing that would allow vulnerable clients to connect to it. Wpa_supplicant, also supported on Linux and Android, is used to connect to wireless networks. “My Cupid patch is a series of modifications to those programs to trigger the vulnerability in order to check for vulnerable clients and servers,” researcher Luis Grangeia told Threatpost. Grangeia’s attacks exploit Heartbleed without establishing a full TLS handshake. Grangeia’s attacks exploit Heartbleed without establishing a full TLS handshake, sending an illicit heartbeat request right after Client Hello and before any crypto keys or certificates have been exchanged, he said. This behavior, meanwhile, is expressly forbidden in the TLS specification. Heartbleed is a vulnerability in certain OpenSSL implementations. Despite the availability of a patch and encouraging remediation numbers from several sources, attacks have been escalating against VPN infrastructure, critical industrial control systems and others, in addition to vulnerable web servers. Heartbleed is an exploit against a problem in OpenSSL’s heartbeat functionality, which if enabled, returns 64KB of memory in plaintext to any client or server requesting a connection. Already, there have been reports of attackers using Heartbleed to steal user names, session IDs, credentials and other data in plaintext if the attack is repeated enough times. More critically, researchers have also been able to piece together enough information to successfully reproduce a private SSL key. Grangeia said he has yet to analyze the memory dumps he was able to collect. “My point in releasing the [proof of concept] code is to get more people working on testing different configurations and analyzing the results,” he said. In Grangeia’s attack, the TLS connection is not made over TCP, but rather over EAP, a wireless network authentication framework. Some wired networks built on 802.1x and peer-to-peer connections also use EAP; EAP-PEAP, EAP-TLS and EAP-TTLS connect over TLS, he said. “To exploit vulnerable clients, hostapd (with the cupid patch) can be used to setup an ‘evil’ network such that, when the vulnerable client tries to connect and requests a TLS connection, hostapd will send malicious heartbeat requests, triggering the vulnerability,” Grangeia explained on his website. “To exploit vulnerable servers we can use wpa_supplicant with the cupid patch. We request a connection to a vulnerable network and then send a heartbeat request right after the TLS connection is made.” The attacks work on password-protected networks because the vulnerability is triggered before a user would have to authenticate, he said. Grangeia pointed out that the default installations of both wireless programs can be exploited on Ubuntu Linux running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL. He said that Android 4.1.0 and 4.1.1. also ship with a vulnerable version of OpenSSL and use wpa_supplicant to connect to wireless networks, and could be vulnerable as well. Grangeia said he was not able to test the vulnerable versions of Android. “This needs to be tested in practice, as Google (or other phone manufacturers) could have compiled OpenSSL with the heartbeat extensions turned off,” he said. In the meantime, enterprise network managers should be double checking their wireless deployments. “I actually believe the most serious attack vectors are vulnerable corporate wireless solutions and network access control solutions,” he said. “Vendors should double check their firmware and notify customers, because this vulnerability has the potential to give attackers an open door to their customer’s networks.” : Vulnerabilities","T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1021 Remote Services,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] The Heartbleed OpenSSL vulnerability can be exploited over wireless networks, according to a researcher who released PoC code for attacks against wireless authentication programs hostapd and wpa_supplicant.

"Threatpost Senior Editor Tara Seals is joined by Russ Mohr, engineer and Apple evangelist at MobileIron along with Jerry Ray, COO at SecureAge, for a discussion about the now postponed Tokyo Games and its use of 5G and the myriad of security concerns Japan is preparing for. The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were officially postponed this week amid the ongoing, pandemic spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The Games will be moved to 2021, but in the meantime, technological innovation around the event will continue. More specifically, postponed or not, the Tokyo Olympics will be the world’s greatest testbed for 5G. It will showcase all of the power and promise that the next-gen mobile technology offers, including enabling everything from flying cars (yes, really!) to widespread facial recognition and security-scanning robots to cover 8 million people. Japan hopes to win the gold medal in the internet of things category, in other words. Most importantly, Japan’s 5G ramp-up also offers a raft of important security lessons for everyday businesses. Important use cases emerging at the Games translate to the wider world (automated authentication for physical access to facilities, for instance — or smart applications like low-latency robotics that can apply in factory settings). And along with that, the cybersecurity measures that Japan has taken — like applying artificial intelligence/machine learning, zero-trust and advanced encryption — are also important object lessons for everyday enterprises. On a webinar last week, Threatpost senior editor Tara Seals was joined by Russ Mohr, engineer and Apple Evangelist at MobileIron; and Jerry Ray, COO at SecureAge, for a discussion about all of the cool things that Tokyo Games have planned for 5G, overall 2020 5G use cases, the next generation of security concerns, and what we can learn and apply from Japan’s experience so far. Please see below for the replay. A transcript of the webinar follows. And, readers can directly access the video on YouTube, here: Amid Olympics Uncertainty, 5G Security Lessons Emerge.   Tara Seals: Hello everyone, this is Tara Seals, senior editor at Threatpost. I’d like to thank everybody for joining us today for our webinar, “5G, the Olympics and Next Generation Security Challenges.” Today, we are going to be hearing from a couple of experts in the arena: Russ Mohr who is an engineer and Apple Evangelist at MobileIron; and also Jerry Ray, who is a COO at SecureAge – he works in Tokyo quite a bit, so he will have some feet-on-the-ground information for us, which is great. Something to note about our agenda, clearly: The hook here is that we’re going to use the Tokyo Summer Games as a jumping off point to discuss what’s possible with 5G technology rolling out. Clearly, it’s an enormous test bed. There’s been a lot of innovation going on. ramping up to the event. And clearly with the coronavirus pandemic, there are concerns about whether or not the Olympics will go on as scheduled. They might be postponed, possibly even as long as a year or two. We’re just not sure. Right now, the IOC and the Japanese government are both saying that the show will go on, but that of course remains to be seen, so fingers crossed. But nonetheless, we think that regardless of cancellation or not, this is going to be a very interesting discussion because again, what they’re doing in advance preparation for the Olympics is absolutely amazing from a technological standpoint. Obviously, that brings along a lot of security concerns. We’re going to talk about some of those and we’re going to bring this back where it’s applicable to you guys in the audience, into your businesses, and talk a little bit about what the security concerns from a macro-perspective are and how they relate to your businesses. And also provide some points and best practices for how they can develop their 5G strategies as we go forward. With that, I am going to pass the ball over here for our first presenter, who is Russ Mohr with MobileIron. Russ, welcome to our webinar. Thank you very much. Russ Mohr: Thank you, Tara. Appreciate the intro. Threatpost, thanks so much for having myself and Jerry Ray here today. We’re really excited to talk to you about the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics. As always, you can reach me @rhmohr on Twitter, R-H-M-O-H-R. I do tweet a lot, especially about 5G security these days. Tokyo Olympics, really something to look forward to if they do happen. As Tara mentioned, there is some risk right now. But we should see around 11,000 athletes there. It looks like there are almost 8 million tickets that are going to be sold for this event ,and there’ll be 33 different sports in Tokyo. But that’s not what interests us today. We want to talk a little bit about the technology we’re going to see. To start off, this is a Toyota self-driving car, and we’re going to be seeing a lot of this at the Olympic games. This one might actually be used to escort an athlete or a staff member onto the field. I think this only actually holds one or two people in it, but that’s not the only autonomous driving that we’re going to be seeing at the games. We’re going to be moving people around in autonomous vehicles. Obviously these are going to need connectivity. They are not going to be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks. We’re going to be leveraging 5G networks, built primarily by NTT DoCoMo, for the games. Also, some 5G cars from another carrier and Toyota. This particular vehicle I think can move around 12 people at once or so. But the real prize of the show, if we see this, and this is still rumored, is Toyota is going to show their flying car at the game. Codenamed Morizo, announced as far back as 2017, but we’re really hoping that we would be able to see an autonomous flying vehicle at the 2020 Olympics. Lots of different applications for 5G technology. Some of them include big investments from companies like a NEC, Panasonic and others. In this particular case, we’re seeing facial recognition. At these events, I mentioned there’s 11,000 athletes, but with all the staff and all the tertiary requirements for people moving in and out of the stadiums, they expect to have 300,000 authorized personnel working at the Olympics. We’re still going to have the lanyard that this young lady is holding in her hand, but we’re also going to have an additional security mechanism, which is facial recognition. These are going to be all over the place, spread throughout Tokyo at the different venues, and they’re going to be amassing a lot of personally identifiable information (PII) about these people. At least a data set of 300,000 records of personal information that are now presumably going to be stored somewhere in the cloud. We’ll have additional security, but we’ll also be creating some new honeypots of highly secure information at these names. Another thing that we’re definitely going to see is a lot of augmented reality, virtual reality, and especially, we’re going to see mixed reality. One of those technologies for mixed reality is going to be called 3DAT, a.k.a. 3D Athlete Tracking. Another one is actually the virtual arena. A virtual arena is also sometimes referred to as a digital twin. What they’re actually able to do is make an exact copy of an arena where an event is going to take place, and then have staff or even athletes walk through that arena, interact with that arena, make plans about where they’re going to be, what the best viewing point is in that arena. That’s going to require lots of edge compute power to show those graphics in real time, but also, it’s going to require very little latency. You’re going to be able to need to react in real time with that stadium. The other thing I mentioned is 3DAT. I actually want to show you what this looks like. This is 3D Athlete Tracking in action. What we can see over here is, we have three leaders in this race clearly, and we are able to actually track them and we’re actually be able to point at who the winners are. That’s even in advance of the Olympic officials saying, these were the winners. We at home using the 3DAT technology, we’ll be able to track where a swimmer is in a race, where a runner is in a race. Often, these races are won within just a few milliseconds. That’s going to be really important. That’s one of the main things that 5G brings to us: Ultra-reliable low latency connections that allow us to have as low as one millisecond of latency. Another reason why 5G is going to be very important for these games. Of course, a lot of these events are going to be transmitted in 8K digital video this year. That’s also going to require a lot of bandwidth and a lot of low-latency connections. What you see here actually is an image from PyeongChang a few years back when we had the winter Olympics, and what you’re looking at, that Olympic logo, is actually drones. Drones are going to play a very big part in these games. For instance, Panasonic will be offering technology around crowd control. NEC will also be in the mix. They’ll be monitoring the crowds, [looking for], is there suspicious activity happening in that crowd, but also be reporting and broadcasting video from these drones. Drones are going to have a very big role in the 2020 Japan Olympics, but at the same time, we also need to protect our drones and protect the attendees and the athletes at these events. It’s a safe assumption that there will not only be friendly drones collecting information and broadcasting events, but there will also be another kind of drone that’s able to take out a rogue drone, for example. We should expect that both of those will be present at the 2020 games. Of course, drones need very low-latency communications. They need to react very quickly. That’s something 5G gives us. I couldn’t complete this presentation about technology we’re going to see at the 2020 games without showing you guys some cute robots. These robots are going to help visitors, so we should expect to see them in the airports, in the subways. They can give you directions in multiple languages, and at the same time, they can also scan the crowds for suspicious activities. They’ll have more than one role. We are expecting to see quite a few of these robots deployed for the 2020 games. Now that I talked to you about some of the technology that we’re expecting the Olympics to unlock, how does that relate 5G? What are the technologies that are specifically relevant to what we’ve been talking about? First off, I’d just like to level-set and let you know that 5G’s in order of magnitude faster than 4G. Up to 10 gigabits down – and using some multiplexing technologies, even up to 20 gigabits downstream speeds. There are two specific technologies I’d like to call out that will be really important: Enhanced mobile broadband isn’t on this slide, but that’s actually what consumers will see on their devices. On the Samsung phones, on the Huawei phones that already have 5G chipsets. On the iPhone, that’s going to be announced in the fall. We’re expecting it to have a 5G chip set on that device as well. Those speeds won’t be quite as high as the 20 gig down. There’ll be a little slower. As we roll out over the years, we’ll see speeds increase. The really important technology that is part of the 5G spec put out by the 3GPP is MMTC, which is massive machine type communications. That just means that we can have an extremely high density of devices riding on a 5G network, many more devices than we can have on a 4G network, for example. This is the high frequency low delay part of 5G. This is the spectrum that allows us to actually hit the sub one-millimeter bandwidth delay. Another piece of technology that we’re going to see carved out and in the 2020 Olympics is the radio access network, commonly referred to as network slicing. Many of the carriers have offerings around this already. This is where you can actually provision a private 5G network with quality of service. You could say, “Look, those robots, they only need 30 millisecond delay. I will configure a network slice for them, but those drones are going to need two milliseconds of delay. They need to react quickly, so I’m going to create another network that has that quality of service on it.” That is leveraging URLLC, ultra-reliable low latency communications. Finally, another technology we’re going to see that’s going to be very important in the games is MEC: Multi-access Edge Computing. We’ve seen a lot of partnerships with Intel at the games are around this, and this is really just compute power. This is the idea of bringing the application closer to the application server. When we’re running a drone network, when we’re running autonomous vehicles, they might need to communicate more quickly with a server. Even if you have an AWS, it might be somewhere in the very core of that network, so we want to get that to the edge of the network. We want to have the compute power as close to the end devices as we can, and that’s what MEC is all about. I’m sure you’ll be reading a lot of announcements around partnerships around MEC over the coming years. Now that we talked about what are the applications and what’s the technology enabling them, let’s just talk quickly about what the risks are. There are a few risks with 5G. Number one is, we have protocol vulnerabilities. We had some announced at Black Hat last year. We had some researchers from Purdue and the University of Iowa build a tool called the 5G reasoner, that found that 5G networks, in theory, were susceptible to all sorts of attacks, including man in the middle, replay attacks that run up your phone bill, and actually hijacking the paging channel. In the U.S., we would call this an Amber Alert – so you could broadcast your own Amber Alert. There are some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed by the 3GPP governing body. The good news is, 5G’s the most secured a wireless cellular protocol to date. However, it takes some time to roll out, it takes some time to go live in networks around the world, especially when a new revision is released. Another risk is 4G interdependence. We’re not going to see standalone 5G everywhere in 2020. As a matter of fact, it’s probably going to be closer to 2025 when we see pure 5G networks. That means that we will sometimes fall back to 4G or even slower technologies when 5G is not present or when we move away from a 5G small-cell tower. Other risks are supply-chain trust. This one has been in the news a lot. In Japan, I believe that they don’t trust Huawei at all. They don’t have Huawei in their networks, at least in the 5G portion for KDDI, DoCoMo, Rakuten and SoftBank. But in other countries, we do have this issue where there may be a company that we don’t trust in the network. In particular, Huawei has been accused of leveraging the lawful-intercept interface, which is what a law-enforcement agency would use to tap into. In the U.S., they would require a warrant to do this, but they could do things like access call-detail records, see when and where a call was placed or even listening to a phone call. So…we’re not sure we can trust every network in every country. [Another risk is] just the pure density of it. 5G uses small cells. Small cells are about the size of a shoe box. There’ll be a lot of them out there. Just the fact that there’s going to be so much of this, it’s going to be a little bit easier for hackers to hide in plain sight. There’s off-the-shelf technology that they can buy called Stingrays, also referred to as dirt boxes or MZ catchers, that can grab information about your device, including location sometimes, and be used to launch exploits. Finally, we’re going to see user behavior change a lot. Hey, if you’re an employee walking into your company and you have a much faster network that you’re already connected to on 5G and the applications that you’re using are cloud applications like Office 365 or Slack or Workday, you might not ever actually connect to a network that sits behind the firewall that your company can control. There’ll be less connecting to Wi-FI. What can we do to address some of that? One of the things I love to talk about is the zero-trust model. This was first coined by an analyst named John Kindervag back in 2010. The essential principle of zero-trust is, we actually never trust and we always verify. We actually have to assume that because of all those vulnerabilities and risks that I just showed around 5G, that we might not actually be able to trust that network. By the way, there’s going to be a bunch of new sports in the 2020 Olympics, and one of them is skateboarding, which is going to be super-fun to watch. But also on this slide are some of the things we need to consider when it comes to building zero-trust defenses for 5G. One of them is, a lot of the primary devices connecting to them (and a lot of the data) is going to reside on devices like iOS and Android. Maybe Windows 10 and Mac OS as well when they have 5G chips. We need to make sure that we can trust the device. We need to consider how are we going to analyze data from lots of different types of devices that are running different operating systems, and we don’t really have a way to control them. We might need to think about agentless internet of things (IoT). How can we take the data from hundreds of thousands, or millions, or tens of billions of devices and analyze that data in the cloud using AI to look for anomalies? Another thing we should really be considering is conditional access. Once we decide whether we trust the IoT device or the iPhone or Android device, we need decide if we trust you, are we going to allow you into the network? Or if we don’t trust you, maybe you can’t have access to the 300,000 facial recognition imprints that I am storing up in the cloud. Conditional access, we need to be able to make a decision about that. Network segmentation is very important. Once you get access to a network that sits beyond 5G, like a corporate network or an internal Olympic network, we need to make sure that you actually can’t get very far once you’re in there. Then, basic security sanity, we need to have encryption. We need to encrypt those 300,000 records of athlete identity and staff identity. We also need to encrypt it in transit. Leveraging SSL, leveraging off-the-shelf VPN technology would be important. Then lastly, I think we need to decide who has access to that data, where’s that data going to be stored. Most likely in the cloud. We need to really think about how we do rule-based access control to sensitive data that sits in the cloud. Those are some of the things that I think we should be thinking about for 5G, and that I think the Olympic committee should be thinking about. With that, I would like to pass it off to Jerry Ray to continue with the presentation. Jerry Ray: Thank you very much, Russ. Thank you for that lead-in as well. You ended with a comment about encryption, encrypting the data. That’s my background and somewhat my purpose and really where the focus of the work I do here for the government and military of Singapore, and what the government of Japan is focused on: Just securing that data. With that in mind, for all the listeners, where Russ’s was just tremendously visual and showing all the exciting things that 5G is bringing to life at the Olympics, mine is precisely the opposite. It’s dealing with that data on the backside, the things that can’t be seen, the massive troves of generated data that are going to come about from each one of those devices. With that, don’t expect too much visually here. I’ll be talking a bit about what it is to secure this data and what type of mindset it took for Japan to put things in place to secure the data. The challenges that 5G bring about are ones that are perfectly attuned to Japan’s vision for the society 5.0. They want to bring together this mesh of technology and devices, not just the standalone information of society 4.0, but in 5.0, make sure these devices, these IoT pieces, are everywhere and that they are accessible. And it’s 5G that’s making that possible. But to get there has not been an easy battle for Japan. Cybersecurity there has had a number of issues for quite some time, and the Olympics were just the perfect mechanism to launch them into a new era of that. Just as 5G is coming about for mobility, the Olympics themselves are bringing Japan to a new era in security mindset. I’m going to focus a bit on that as we move on and talk some more about encryption as well. Forgive the bullet points here, but Japan is just like any other place, and many of the issues it was facing leading up to the Olympics now and before are once that everyone else is seeing: Technology is just rapidly increasing and overwhelming us. Security rarely gets the attention it needs. It’s the backend piece that was thought of after all of the exciting pieces Russ showed us visually were built and configured. At the very end, we’re going to throw some security on. As well, what do we buy? What do we use? There are so many claims in so many categories, whether it’s EDR, EDP. It’s just, which is the right tool to protect this particular piece of data? Data at rest? Data in motion? This streaming data that’s going to be coming from the tools and products that we’re going to see at the Olympics [and elsewhere] are going to make those questions even more complex. Now, how do we secure the facility’s gates? How do we secure the filmography from the drones? What about the facial-recognition systems, and what about the pure data that’s up in the air that’s allowing all the communications to take place in these massive, massive pipelines of streaming data? We’re also seeing that cybercriminals and nation states, they get a much bigger bang for their money in 5G when they want to attack things, and the Olympics is the high-profile moment in any country’s existence, and it’s also the perfect time to put a black eye on it. We saw that somewhat in PyeongChang two years ago, a cyberattack right on the outset. We saw it in Brazil two years before that. It’s very easy for people to come up with low-cost ways, low-barrier ways to do something. Just make things go awry, embarrass the host as much as they can. We’ve also seen a long history of security tools that were just simply ineffective despite the growing number of tools that are out there for people to protect themselves. The number of breaches are expanding even more quickly than those. Japan has to deal with all of these. It’s got Olympics to organize, but on top of that it’s got its own history that it has to deal with. For quite some time they’ve been lagging in legislation. They just haven’t had mandates there for things like disclosing cyberattacks or data breaches to the citizenry. They’ve got inherently a tremendous level of trust and reliance on systems. Whether these systems are social or technical, Japan believes that they simply work. When you’ve got people who are intentionally trying to undermine these systems, and again referring back to the nation-states or motivated hackers, it’s hard to envision that these systems are ones that people would actively try to tear down when they were so thoughtfully put up in the first place. There’s also some issues with leadership in Japan, and not that the leadership is poor, it’s just the way they put people in leadership positions to make these cybersecurity decisions. Japan is quite famous for having rotating jobs within companies and this expands onto the government as well. Two-year rotations, three-year rotations, and these rotations don’t necessarily follow expertise or education. As people are moving forward in their career, they can take on a variety of different jobs and get training, very relevant and solid training within their companies, but not quite enough that would allow them to spearhead something as significant as cybersecurity. With these Japan-specific cyber-challenges, it’s really something that they were able to recognize this, use the Olympics and the rollout of 5G as the impetus to make it all better. They’ve really done a great thing in putting things in line, having run through a great number of iterations of trials since 2014, hoping they would get the games. Once it was announced, they immediately got busy. Knowing that Olympics is that spectacle, the equivalent to the world’s fair to show who you are. Tokyo hasn’t had this opportunity since 1964 and they wanted to make the most of it, but it was just brilliant that they did what they did in terms of security. They enacted some new legislation and they have this IoT cybersecurity action program that they put into place in 2017. IoT is one of the biggest concerns for them. They even took it upon themselves in 2019 to create a mandate to attack IoT devices of the citizens of Japan. Whether the whole citizenry knew it or not, these attacks were undertaken and Japan learned a great deal about the vulnerability of most types of IoT devices and what they should be putting in place to protect the ones that will be either running the games or protecting the critical infrastructure of Japan throughout the period of the games and thereafter. Japan has also allocated a great deal of funding from the government to allow these advances in security to take place. They set up a National Cyber Training Center. They increased cyber security drills from six to 10 times a year. They’ve also made an effort to put government and private industry together to create these entities, such as the cybersecurity factory, which is a collaboration between NEC and the government. Finally, they’ve invested heavily in training. Training at the university level and on through companies and other entities. It’s really something that Japan was able to put together in a way that, spending most of my adult life in Tokyo, seeing that only Japan can. It’s highly organized. When it puts its mind to any task, it does it extraordinarily well. Again, I pointed just a few moments ago about IoT and critical infrastructure being those two target areas that Japan is worried about most. It’s 5G that’s making this all come about. 5G is bringing IoT devices to life in a way they haven’t been, and critical infrastructure will be relying on sensors and other tools that can be connected rapidly and at greater distances via 5G. This is another vulnerability that’s being imposed. Most of what Japan’s done, it’s all going to protect IoT and critical infrastructure. The ways it’s protecting it, my particular focus and interests will always be on the actual data itself, because all of these devices, everything in critical infrastructure is generating data that is now giving us a nonstop tap. Everything is going to constantly be in motion. Everything’s going to be increasing. The datasets we have will be more complex, but also more rich. The things we can do with them, well, they’ll only be meaningful if we can protect that data. The other piece that’s going to come up within IoT and critical infrastructure protection is artificial intelligence (AI) itself. There’s going to be a great deal of reliance on what AI can do. Russ mentioned it a bit ago in terms of sifting through the data sets, but also protecting it, recognizing threats, doing things that couldn’t be done from any manual attempts by humans, regardless of their level of expertise. Just by the mass exposure that AI will have to the different threat vectors and actions by nation-states and otherwise. The real catch here on the AI portion is that it takes training and it takes time. The amount of time, the amount of opportunities for training for AI that are going to be involved with IoT and critical infrastructure — I worry a bit that nothing’s yet going to be really robust enough to handle some of the security issues that are going to come up within just a couple of months — if indeed the Olympics happen in a couple of months. It’s something that I think everyone will face, whether it’s an Olympic-bound issue or not. That brings me back to what I was speaking a bit ago about – how products and tools are going to be something that Japan and every other country is going to struggle with as they look to secure these 5G networks. How can you have tools that are going to be secure, without really limiting all the advances and the engagement that viewers can have when enjoying these advanced augmented reality and virtual reality opportunities from 5G. Also, the straightforward implementation. These are complex. 5G is going to just multiply the complexity of things, particularly as various IoT devices come on board, each with their own operating system, each with their own security protocol. Finally, regulatory compliance is something that has to be considered and tools have to be available, simply for covering all the different regulations that address either particular populations or particular pieces of data. GDPR from the EU: We’ve got to consider the EU residents who will have any interactivity here at the Olympics and beyond. It’s quite a challenge. With that, I’d like to opening it up to different questions, hopefully more for Russ, and have Tara join in. Tara Seals: Great. Thank you, Jerry. Okay. Yes. We can move to our Q&A session. I’d like to thank both of you for those two absolutely fascinating presentations, lots of great content in there for sure. There’s room to talk about other things as well Let me ask, from just a purely real-world standpoint, if I’m a U.S.-based business, what are some of the initial 5G use cases that I might want to implement within my corporate world that will change the game for security. Russ, maybe you can take a stab at that. Russ Mohr: Yeah. So, is the question from the standpoint of a business or the standpoint of just a consumer? Tara Seals: From a business standpoint. Corporations and even SMBs, I would think would find rich ground for making use of some of the step-changes in 5G that we’re going to see, right? Russ Mohr: Yeah. Well, they absolutely will. I’m located in New York, in the U.S., and I work with carriers quite a bit in my day-to-day transactions. I’m seeing a big push, especially in the U.S. from Verizon and AT&T, around selling 5G services to the enterprise. The main thing that they are pushing is last-mile backhaul. A lot of them invested a lot of money putting fiber in the ground, which has a very long rate of return. It takes a long time to get that money back. Backhaul services over 5G networks are much faster than what they’ve been doing traditionally and much cheaper for them. Then, the other thing we talked about was network slicing. We especially see a lot of this in manufacturing. You have an autonomously guided vehicle, an AGV – let’s say you’re Ford Motor Company and you’ve got a factory with an assembly line and you’ve got a forklift that needs to be able to stop in 20 or 30 milliseconds. 5G’s a really good fit for you, especially on an ultra-reliable low latency private 5G network, because you have that low latency and you’re able to make decisions quickly enough so that somebody doesn’t get hurt. Also, in the enterprise, like take car manufacturing. If you had an assembly line and you want it to analyze data very quickly to see if something was going to break soon on that assembly line and stop it before you had to shut down for a day, then that would also be really interesting for you. You might combine it with MEC or you might combine it with AI in the cloud. Those are two really big use cases that I see for it in the enterprise. I also think that the enterprise networks are going to change, the whole traditional boundary of the firewall, that’s just not going to exist anymore because of user behavior changes, so enterprise needs to think about, what is the security approach for that? As I mentioned, Gartner has something called SASE, which stands for Secure Access Service Edge. Forrester calls it zero-trust. I really think the enterprise needs to take some time thinking about like shifting to that model instead of making the traditional security investments that they’ve been making. Tara Seals: Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. A related question to that, what are some of the ways that hackers may try to penetrate someone’s 5G footprint? Are there new attack vectors to be considered there? Or is it just sort of more of the same IoT security story that we’ve seen a lot of. What’s different? What’s new? Russ Mohr: I mentioned in the presentation that, first of all, there are vulnerabilities.

The 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo were officially postponed this week amid the ongoing, pandemic spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The Games will be moved to 2021, but in the meantime, technological innovation around the event will continue. More specifically, postponed or not, the Tokyo Olympics will be the world’s greatest testbed for 5G. It will showcase all of the power and promise that the next-gen mobile technology offers, including enabling everything from flying cars (yes, really!) to widespread facial recognition and security-scanning robots to cover 8 million people. Japan hopes to win the gold medal in the internet of things category, in other words. Most importantly, Japan’s 5G ramp-up also offers a raft of important security lessons for everyday businesses. Important use cases emerging at the Games translate to the wider world (automated authentication for physical access to facilities, for instance — or smart applications like low-latency robotics that can apply in factory settings). And along with that, the cybersecurity measures that Japan has taken — like applying artificial intelligence/machine learning, zero-trust and advanced encryption — are also important object lessons for everyday enterprises. On a webinar last week, Threatpost senior editor Tara Seals was joined by Russ Mohr, engineer and Apple Evangelist at MobileIron; and Jerry Ray, COO at SecureAge, for a discussion about all of the cool things that Tokyo Games have planned for 5G, overall 2020 5G use cases, the next generation of security concerns, and what we can learn and apply from Japan’s experience so far. Please see below for the replay. A transcript of the webinar follows. And, readers can directly access the video on YouTube, here: Amid Olympics Uncertainty, 5G Security Lessons Emerge.   Tara Seals: Hello everyone, this is Tara Seals, senior editor at Threatpost. I’d like to thank everybody for joining us today for our webinar, “5G, the Olympics and Next Generation Security Challenges.” Today, we are going to be hearing from a couple of experts in the arena: Russ Mohr who is an engineer and Apple Evangelist at MobileIron; and also Jerry Ray, who is a COO at SecureAge – he works in Tokyo quite a bit, so he will have some feet-on-the-ground information for us, which is great. Something to note about our agenda, clearly: The hook here is that we’re going to use the Tokyo Summer Games as a jumping off point to discuss what’s possible with 5G technology rolling out. Clearly, it’s an enormous test bed. There’s been a lot of innovation going on. ramping up to the event. And clearly with the coronavirus pandemic, there are concerns about whether or not the Olympics will go on as scheduled. They might be postponed, possibly even as long as a year or two. We’re just not sure. Right now, the IOC and the Japanese government are both saying that the show will go on, but that of course remains to be seen, so fingers crossed. But nonetheless, we think that regardless of cancellation or not, this is going to be a very interesting discussion because again, what they’re doing in advance preparation for the Olympics is absolutely amazing from a technological standpoint. Obviously, that brings along a lot of security concerns. We’re going to talk about some of those and we’re going to bring this back where it’s applicable to you guys in the audience, into your businesses, and talk a little bit about what the security concerns from a macro-perspective are and how they relate to your businesses. And also provide some points and best practices for how they can develop their 5G strategies as we go forward. With that, I am going to pass the ball over here for our first presenter, who is Russ Mohr with MobileIron. Russ, welcome to our webinar. Thank you very much. Russ Mohr: Thank you, Tara. Appreciate the intro. Threatpost, thanks so much for having myself and Jerry Ray here today. We’re really excited to talk to you about the upcoming Tokyo 2020 Olympics. As always, you can reach me @rhmohr on Twitter, R-H-M-O-H-R. I do tweet a lot, especially about 5G security these days. Tokyo Olympics, really something to look forward to if they do happen. As Tara mentioned, there is some risk right now. But we should see around 11,000 athletes there. It looks like there are almost 8 million tickets that are going to be sold for this event ,and there’ll be 33 different sports in Tokyo. But that’s not what interests us today. We want to talk a little bit about the technology we’re going to see. To start off, this is a Toyota self-driving car, and we’re going to be seeing a lot of this at the Olympic games. This one might actually be used to escort an athlete or a staff member onto the field. I think this only actually holds one or two people in it, but that’s not the only autonomous driving that we’re going to be seeing at the games. We’re going to be moving people around in autonomous vehicles. Obviously these are going to need connectivity. They are not going to be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks. We’re going to be leveraging 5G networks, built primarily by NTT DoCoMo, for the games. Also, some 5G cars from another carrier and Toyota. This particular vehicle I think can move around 12 people at once or so. But the real prize of the show, if we see this, and this is still rumored, is Toyota is going to show their flying car at the game. Codenamed Morizo, announced as far back as 2017, but we’re really hoping that we would be able to see an autonomous flying vehicle at the 2020 Olympics. Lots of different applications for 5G technology. Some of them include big investments from companies like a NEC, Panasonic and others. In this particular case, we’re seeing facial recognition. At these events, I mentioned there’s 11,000 athletes, but with all the staff and all the tertiary requirements for people moving in and out of the stadiums, they expect to have 300,000 authorized personnel working at the Olympics. We’re still going to have the lanyard that this young lady is holding in her hand, but we’re also going to have an additional security mechanism, which is facial recognition. These are going to be all over the place, spread throughout Tokyo at the different venues, and they’re going to be amassing a lot of personally identifiable information (PII) about these people. At least a data set of 300,000 records of personal information that are now presumably going to be stored somewhere in the cloud. We’ll have additional security, but we’ll also be creating some new honeypots of highly secure information at these names. Another thing that we’re definitely going to see is a lot of augmented reality, virtual reality, and especially, we’re going to see mixed reality. One of those technologies for mixed reality is going to be called 3DAT, a.k.a. 3D Athlete Tracking. Another one is actually the virtual arena. A virtual arena is also sometimes referred to as a digital twin. What they’re actually able to do is make an exact copy of an arena where an event is going to take place, and then have staff or even athletes walk through that arena, interact with that arena, make plans about where they’re going to be, what the best viewing point is in that arena. That’s going to require lots of edge compute power to show those graphics in real time, but also, it’s going to require very little latency. You’re going to be able to need to react in real time with that stadium. The other thing I mentioned is 3DAT. I actually want to show you what this looks like. This is 3D Athlete Tracking in action. What we can see over here is, we have three leaders in this race clearly, and we are able to actually track them and we’re actually be able to point at who the winners are. That’s even in advance of the Olympic officials saying, these were the winners. We at home using the 3DAT technology, we’ll be able to track where a swimmer is in a race, where a runner is in a race. Often, these races are won within just a few milliseconds. That’s going to be really important. That’s one of the main things that 5G brings to us: Ultra-reliable low latency connections that allow us to have as low as one millisecond of latency. Another reason why 5G is going to be very important for these games. Of course, a lot of these events are going to be transmitted in 8K digital video this year. That’s also going to require a lot of bandwidth and a lot of low-latency connections. What you see here actually is an image from PyeongChang a few years back when we had the winter Olympics, and what you’re looking at, that Olympic logo, is actually drones. Drones are going to play a very big part in these games. For instance, Panasonic will be offering technology around crowd control. NEC will also be in the mix. They’ll be monitoring the crowds, [looking for], is there suspicious activity happening in that crowd, but also be reporting and broadcasting video from these drones. Drones are going to have a very big role in the 2020 Japan Olympics, but at the same time, we also need to protect our drones and protect the attendees and the athletes at these events. It’s a safe assumption that there will not only be friendly drones collecting information and broadcasting events, but there will also be another kind of drone that’s able to take out a rogue drone, for example. We should expect that both of those will be present at the 2020 games. Of course, drones need very low-latency communications. They need to react very quickly. That’s something 5G gives us. I couldn’t complete this presentation about technology we’re going to see at the 2020 games without showing you guys some cute robots. These robots are going to help visitors, so we should expect to see them in the airports, in the subways. They can give you directions in multiple languages, and at the same time, they can also scan the crowds for suspicious activities. They’ll have more than one role. We are expecting to see quite a few of these robots deployed for the 2020 games. Now that I talked to you about some of the technology that we’re expecting the Olympics to unlock, how does that relate 5G? What are the technologies that are specifically relevant to what we’ve been talking about? First off, I’d just like to level-set and let you know that 5G’s in order of magnitude faster than 4G. Up to 10 gigabits down – and using some multiplexing technologies, even up to 20 gigabits downstream speeds. There are two specific technologies I’d like to call out that will be really important: Enhanced mobile broadband isn’t on this slide, but that’s actually what consumers will see on their devices. On the Samsung phones, on the Huawei phones that already have 5G chipsets. On the iPhone, that’s going to be announced in the fall. We’re expecting it to have a 5G chip set on that device as well. Those speeds won’t be quite as high as the 20 gig down. There’ll be a little slower. As we roll out over the years, we’ll see speeds increase. The really important technology that is part of the 5G spec put out by the 3GPP is MMTC, which is massive machine type communications. That just means that we can have an extremely high density of devices riding on a 5G network, many more devices than we can have on a 4G network, for example. This is the high frequency low delay part of 5G. This is the spectrum that allows us to actually hit the sub one-millimeter bandwidth delay. Another piece of technology that we’re going to see carved out and in the 2020 Olympics is the radio access network, commonly referred to as network slicing. Many of the carriers have offerings around this already. This is where you can actually provision a private 5G network with quality of service. You could say, “Look, those robots, they only need 30 millisecond delay. I will configure a network slice for them, but those drones are going to need two milliseconds of delay. They need to react quickly, so I’m going to create another network that has that quality of service on it.” That is leveraging URLLC, ultra-reliable low latency communications. Finally, another technology we’re going to see that’s going to be very important in the games is MEC: Multi-access Edge Computing. We’ve seen a lot of partnerships with Intel at the games are around this, and this is really just compute power. This is the idea of bringing the application closer to the application server. When we’re running a drone network, when we’re running autonomous vehicles, they might need to communicate more quickly with a server. Even if you have an AWS, it might be somewhere in the very core of that network, so we want to get that to the edge of the network. We want to have the compute power as close to the end devices as we can, and that’s what MEC is all about. I’m sure you’ll be reading a lot of announcements around partnerships around MEC over the coming years. Now that we talked about what are the applications and what’s the technology enabling them, let’s just talk quickly about what the risks are. There are a few risks with 5G. Number one is, we have protocol vulnerabilities. We had some announced at Black Hat last year. We had some researchers from Purdue and the University of Iowa build a tool called the 5G reasoner, that found that 5G networks, in theory, were susceptible to all sorts of attacks, including man in the middle, replay attacks that run up your phone bill, and actually hijacking the paging channel. In the U.S., we would call this an Amber Alert – so you could broadcast your own Amber Alert. There are some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed by the 3GPP governing body. The good news is, 5G’s the most secured a wireless cellular protocol to date. However, it takes some time to roll out, it takes some time to go live in networks around the world, especially when a new revision is released. Another risk is 4G interdependence. We’re not going to see standalone 5G everywhere in 2020. As a matter of fact, it’s probably going to be closer to 2025 when we see pure 5G networks. That means that we will sometimes fall back to 4G or even slower technologies when 5G is not present or when we move away from a 5G small-cell tower. Other risks are supply-chain trust. This one has been in the news a lot. In Japan, I believe that they don’t trust Huawei at all. They don’t have Huawei in their networks, at least in the 5G portion for KDDI, DoCoMo, Rakuten and SoftBank. But in other countries, we do have this issue where there may be a company that we don’t trust in the network. In particular, Huawei has been accused of leveraging the lawful-intercept interface, which is what a law-enforcement agency would use to tap into. In the U.S., they would require a warrant to do this, but they could do things like access call-detail records, see when and where a call was placed or even listening to a phone call. So…we’re not sure we can trust every network in every country. [Another risk is] just the pure density of it. 5G uses small cells. Small cells are about the size of a shoe box. There’ll be a lot of them out there. Just the fact that there’s going to be so much of this, it’s going to be a little bit easier for hackers to hide in plain sight. There’s off-the-shelf technology that they can buy called Stingrays, also referred to as dirt boxes or MZ catchers, that can grab information about your device, including location sometimes, and be used to launch exploits. Finally, we’re going to see user behavior change a lot. Hey, if you’re an employee walking into your company and you have a much faster network that you’re already connected to on 5G and the applications that you’re using are cloud applications like Office 365 or Slack or Workday, you might not ever actually connect to a network that sits behind the firewall that your company can control. There’ll be less connecting to Wi-FI. What can we do to address some of that? One of the things I love to talk about is the zero-trust model. This was first coined by an analyst named John Kindervag back in 2010. The essential principle of zero-trust is, we actually never trust and we always verify. We actually have to assume that because of all those vulnerabilities and risks that I just showed around 5G, that we might not actually be able to trust that network. By the way, there’s going to be a bunch of new sports in the 2020 Olympics, and one of them is skateboarding, which is going to be super-fun to watch. But also on this slide are some of the things we need to consider when it comes to building zero-trust defenses for 5G. One of them is, a lot of the primary devices connecting to them (and a lot of the data) is going to reside on devices like iOS and Android. Maybe Windows 10 and Mac OS as well when they have 5G chips. We need to make sure that we can trust the device. We need to consider how are we going to analyze data from lots of different types of devices that are running different operating systems, and we don’t really have a way to control them. We might need to think about agentless internet of things (IoT). How can we take the data from hundreds of thousands, or millions, or tens of billions of devices and analyze that data in the cloud using AI to look for anomalies? Another thing we should really be considering is conditional access. Once we decide whether we trust the IoT device or the iPhone or Android device, we need decide if we trust you, are we going to allow you into the network? Or if we don’t trust you, maybe you can’t have access to the 300,000 facial recognition imprints that I am storing up in the cloud. Conditional access, we need to be able to make a decision about that. Network segmentation is very important. Once you get access to a network that sits beyond 5G, like a corporate network or an internal Olympic network, we need to make sure that you actually can’t get very far once you’re in there. Then, basic security sanity, we need to have encryption. We need to encrypt those 300,000 records of athlete identity and staff identity. We also need to encrypt it in transit. Leveraging SSL, leveraging off-the-shelf VPN technology would be important. Then lastly, I think we need to decide who has access to that data, where’s that data going to be stored. Most likely in the cloud. We need to really think about how we do rule-based access control to sensitive data that sits in the cloud. Those are some of the things that I think we should be thinking about for 5G, and that I think the Olympic committee should be thinking about. With that, I would like to pass it off to Jerry Ray to continue with the presentation. Jerry Ray: Thank you very much, Russ. Thank you for that lead-in as well. You ended with a comment about encryption, encrypting the data. That’s my background and somewhat my purpose and really where the focus of the work I do here for the government and military of Singapore, and what the government of Japan is focused on: Just securing that data. With that in mind, for all the listeners, where Russ’s was just tremendously visual and showing all the exciting things that 5G is bringing to life at the Olympics, mine is precisely the opposite. It’s dealing with that data on the backside, the things that can’t be seen, the massive troves of generated data that are going to come about from each one of those devices. With that, don’t expect too much visually here. I’ll be talking a bit about what it is to secure this data and what type of mindset it took for Japan to put things in place to secure the data. The challenges that 5G bring about are ones that are perfectly attuned to Japan’s vision for the society 5.0. They want to bring together this mesh of technology and devices, not just the standalone information of society 4.0, but in 5.0, make sure these devices, these IoT pieces, are everywhere and that they are accessible. And it’s 5G that’s making that possible. But to get there has not been an easy battle for Japan. Cybersecurity there has had a number of issues for quite some time, and the Olympics were just the perfect mechanism to launch them into a new era of that. Just as 5G is coming about for mobility, the Olympics themselves are bringing Japan to a new era in security mindset. I’m going to focus a bit on that as we move on and talk some more about encryption as well. Forgive the bullet points here, but Japan is just like any other place, and many of the issues it was facing leading up to the Olympics now and before are once that everyone else is seeing: Technology is just rapidly increasing and overwhelming us. Security rarely gets the attention it needs. It’s the backend piece that was thought of after all of the exciting pieces Russ showed us visually were built and configured. At the very end, we’re going to throw some security on. As well, what do we buy? What do we use? There are so many claims in so many categories, whether it’s EDR, EDP. It’s just, which is the right tool to protect this particular piece of data? Data at rest? Data in motion? This streaming data that’s going to be coming from the tools and products that we’re going to see at the Olympics [and elsewhere] are going to make those questions even more complex. Now, how do we secure the facility’s gates? How do we secure the filmography from the drones? What about the facial-recognition systems, and what about the pure data that’s up in the air that’s allowing all the communications to take place in these massive, massive pipelines of streaming data? We’re also seeing that cybercriminals and nation states, they get a much bigger bang for their money in 5G when they want to attack things, and the Olympics is the high-profile moment in any country’s existence, and it’s also the perfect time to put a black eye on it. We saw that somewhat in PyeongChang two years ago, a cyberattack right on the outset. We saw it in Brazil two years before that. It’s very easy for people to come up with low-cost ways, low-barrier ways to do something. Just make things go awry, embarrass the host as much as they can. We’ve also seen a long history of security tools that were just simply ineffective despite the growing number of tools that are out there for people to protect themselves. The number of breaches are expanding even more quickly than those. Japan has to deal with all of these. It’s got Olympics to organize, but on top of that it’s got its own history that it has to deal with. For quite some time they’ve been lagging in legislation. They just haven’t had mandates there for things like disclosing cyberattacks or data breaches to the citizenry. They’ve got inherently a tremendous level of trust and reliance on systems. Whether these systems are social or technical, Japan believes that they simply work. When you’ve got people who are intentionally trying to undermine these systems, and again referring back to the nation-states or motivated hackers, it’s hard to envision that these systems are ones that people would actively try to tear down when they were so thoughtfully put up in the first place. There’s also some issues with leadership in Japan, and not that the leadership is poor, it’s just the way they put people in leadership positions to make these cybersecurity decisions. Japan is quite famous for having rotating jobs within companies and this expands onto the government as well. Two-year rotations, three-year rotations, and these rotations don’t necessarily follow expertise or education. As people are moving forward in their career, they can take on a variety of different jobs and get training, very relevant and solid training within their companies, but not quite enough that would allow them to spearhead something as significant as cybersecurity. With these Japan-specific cyber-challenges, it’s really something that they were able to recognize this, use the Olympics and the rollout of 5G as the impetus to make it all better. They’ve really done a great thing in putting things in line, having run through a great number of iterations of trials since 2014, hoping they would get the games. Once it was announced, they immediately got busy. Knowing that Olympics is that spectacle, the equivalent to the world’s fair to show who you are. Tokyo hasn’t had this opportunity since 1964 and they wanted to make the most of it, but it was just brilliant that they did what they did in terms of security. They enacted some new legislation and they have this IoT cybersecurity action program that they put into place in 2017. IoT is one of the biggest concerns for them. They even took it upon themselves in 2019 to create a mandate to attack IoT devices of the citizens of Japan. Whether the whole citizenry knew it or not, these attacks were undertaken and Japan learned a great deal about the vulnerability of most types of IoT devices and what they should be putting in place to protect the ones that will be either running the games or protecting the critical infrastructure of Japan throughout the period of the games and thereafter. Japan has also allocated a great deal of funding from the government to allow these advances in security to take place. They set up a National Cyber Training Center. They increased cyber security drills from six to 10 times a year. They’ve also made an effort to put government and private industry together to create these entities, such as the cybersecurity factory, which is a collaboration between NEC and the government. Finally, they’ve invested heavily in training. Training at the university level and on through companies and other entities. It’s really something that Japan was able to put together in a way that, spending most of my adult life in Tokyo, seeing that only Japan can. It’s highly organized. When it puts its mind to any task, it does it extraordinarily well. Again, I pointed just a few moments ago about IoT and critical infrastructure being those two target areas that Japan is worried about most. It’s 5G that’s making this all come about. 5G is bringing IoT devices to life in a way they haven’t been, and critical infrastructure will be relying on sensors and other tools that can be connected rapidly and at greater distances via 5G. This is another vulnerability that’s being imposed. Most of what Japan’s done, it’s all going to protect IoT and critical infrastructure. The ways it’s protecting it, my particular focus and interests will always be on the actual data itself, because all of these devices, everything in critical infrastructure is generating data that is now giving us a nonstop tap. Everything is going to constantly be in motion. Everything’s going to be increasing. The datasets we have will be more complex, but also more rich. The things we can do with them, well, they’ll only be meaningful if we can protect that data. The other piece that’s going to come up within IoT and critical infrastructure protection is artificial intelligence (AI) itself. There’s going to be a great deal of reliance on what AI can do. Russ mentioned it a bit ago in terms of sifting through the data sets, but also protecting it, recognizing threats, doing things that couldn’t be done from any manual attempts by humans, regardless of their level of expertise. Just by the mass exposure that AI will have to the different threat vectors and actions by nation-states and otherwise. The real catch here on the AI portion is that it takes training and it takes time. The amount of time, the amount of opportunities for training for AI that are going to be involved with IoT and critical infrastructure — I worry a bit that nothing’s yet going to be really robust enough to handle some of the security issues that are going to come up within just a couple of months — if indeed the Olympics happen in a couple of months. It’s something that I think everyone will face, whether it’s an Olympic-bound issue or not. That brings me back to what I was speaking a bit ago about – how products and tools are going to be something that Japan and every other country is going to struggle with as they look to secure these 5G networks. How can you have tools that are going to be secure, without really limiting all the advances and the engagement that viewers can have when enjoying these advanced augmented reality and virtual reality opportunities from 5G. Also, the straightforward implementation. These are complex. 5G is going to just multiply the complexity of things, particularly as various IoT devices come on board, each with their own operating system, each with their own security protocol. Finally, regulatory compliance is something that has to be considered and tools have to be available, simply for covering all the different regulations that address either particular populations or particular pieces of data. GDPR from the EU: We’ve got to consider the EU residents who will have any interactivity here at the Olympics and beyond. It’s quite a challenge. With that, I’d like to opening it up to different questions, hopefully more for Russ, and have Tara join in. Tara Seals: Great. Thank you, Jerry. Okay. Yes. We can move to our Q&A session. I’d like to thank both of you for those two absolutely fascinating presentations, lots of great content in there for sure. There’s room to talk about other things as well Let me ask, from just a purely real-world standpoint, if I’m a U.S.-based business, what are some of the initial 5G use cases that I might want to implement within my corporate world that will change the game for security. Russ, maybe you can take a stab at that. Russ Mohr: Yeah. So, is the question from the standpoint of a business or the standpoint of just a consumer? Tara Seals: From a business standpoint. Corporations and even SMBs, I would think would find rich ground for making use of some of the step-changes in 5G that we’re going to see, right? Russ Mohr: Yeah. Well, they absolutely will. I’m located in New York, in the U.S., and I work with carriers quite a bit in my day-to-day transactions. I’m seeing a big push, especially in the U.S. from Verizon and AT&T, around selling 5G services to the enterprise. The main thing that they are pushing is last-mile backhaul. A lot of them invested a lot of money putting fiber in the ground, which has a very long rate of return. It takes a long time to get that money back. Backhaul services over 5G networks are much faster than what they’ve been doing traditionally and much cheaper for them. Then, the other thing we talked about was network slicing. We especially see a lot of this in manufacturing. You have an autonomously guided vehicle, an AGV – let’s say you’re Ford Motor Company and you’ve got a factory with an assembly line and you’ve got a forklift that needs to be able to stop in 20 or 30 milliseconds. 5G’s a really good fit for you, especially on an ultra-reliable low latency private 5G network, because you have that low latency and you’re able to make decisions quickly enough so that somebody doesn’t get hurt. Also, in the enterprise, like take car manufacturing. If you had an assembly line and you want it to analyze data very quickly to see if something was going to break soon on that assembly line and stop it before you had to shut down for a day, then that would also be really interesting for you. You might combine it with MEC or you might combine it with AI in the cloud. Those are two really big use cases that I see for it in the enterprise. I also think that the enterprise networks are going to change, the whole traditional boundary of the firewall, that’s just not going to exist anymore because of user behavior changes, so enterprise needs to think about, what is the security approach for that? As I mentioned, Gartner has something called SASE, which stands for Secure Access Service Edge. Forrester calls it zero-trust. I really think the enterprise needs to take some time thinking about like shifting to that model instead of making the traditional security investments that they’ve been making. Tara Seals: Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. A related question to that, what are some of the ways that hackers may try to penetrate someone’s 5G footprint? Are there new attack vectors to be considered there? Or is it just sort of more of the same IoT security story that we’ve seen a lot of. What’s different? What’s new? Russ Mohr: I mentioned in the presentation that, first of all, there are vulnerabilities.

"Full dumps of email boxes, lateral movement and backdoors characterize sophisticated attacks by a Chinese APT \u2013 while more incidents spread like wildfire. Microsoft has spotted multiple zero-day exploits in the wild being used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. Adversaries have been able to access email accounts, steal a raft of data and drop malware on target machines for long-term remote access, according to the computing giant. The attacks are \u201climited and targeted,\u201d according to Microsoft, spurring it to release out-of-band patches this week. The exploited bugs are being tracked as CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065. However, other researchers have reported seeing the activity compromising mass swathes of victim organizations. \u201cThe team is seeing organizations of all shapes and sizes affected, including electricity companies, local/county governments, healthcare providers and banks/financial institutions, as well as small hotels, multiple senior citizen communities and other mid-market businesses,\u201d a spokesperson at Huntress told Threatpost. The culprit is believed to be an advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Hafnium (also the name of a chemical element), which has a history of targeting assets in the United States with cyber-espionage campaigns. Targets in the past have included defense contractors, infectious disease researchers, law firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), policy think tanks and universities. \u201cMicrosoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) attributes this campaign with high confidence to Hafnium, a group assessed to be state-sponsored and operating out of China, based on observed victimology, tactics and procedures,\u201d according to an announcement this week from Microsoft on the attacks. Zero-Day Security Bugs in Exchange Server \u201cThe fact that Microsoft chose to patch these flaws out-of-band rather than include them as part of next week\u2019s Patch Tuesday release leads us to believe the flaws are quite severe even if we don\u2019t know the full scope of those attacks,\u201d Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, said via email. Microsoft patched following bugs this week, and admins should update accordingly: CVE-2021-26855 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that allows authentication bypass: A remote attacker can simply send arbitrary HTTP requests to the Exchange server and be able to authenticate to it. From there, an attacker can steal the full contents of multiple user mailboxes. CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure-deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service, where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. An exploit allows remote attackers with administrator permissions to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 are both post-authentication arbitrary file-write vulnerabilities in Exchange. Once authenticated with an Exchange server (using CVE-2021-26855 or with compromised admin credentials), an attacker could write a file to any path on the server \u2013 thus achieving remote code execution (RCE). Researchers at Volexity originally uncovered the SSRF bug as part of an incident response and noted, \u201cThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication of any kind, nor does it require any special knowledge or access to a target environment. The attacker only needs to know the server running Exchange and the account from which they want to extract email.\u201d They also observed the SSRF bug being chained with CVE-2021-27065 to accomplish RCE in multiple attacks. In addition to Volexity, Microsoft credited security researchers at Dubex with uncovering the recent activity, which was first observed in January. \u201cBased on what we know so far, exploitation of one of the four vulnerabilities requires no authentication whatsoever and can be used to potentially download messages from a targeted user\u2019s mailbox,\u201d said Tenable\u2019s Narang. \u201cThe other vulnerabilities can be chained together by a determined threat actor to facilitate a further compromise of the targeted organization\u2019s network.\u201d What Happened in the Hafnium Attacks? In the observed campaigns, the four zero-day bugs were used to gain initial access to targeted Exchange servers and achieve RCE. Hafnium operators then deployed web shells on the compromised servers, which were used to steal data and expand the attack, according to researchers. \u201cIn all cases of RCE, Volexity has observed the attacker writing webshells (ASPX files) to disk and conducting further operations to dump credentials, add user accounts, steal copies of the Active Directory database (NTDS.DIT) and move laterally to other systems and environments,\u201d according to Volexity\u2019s writeup. Following web shell deployment, Microsoft found that Hafnium operators performed a range of post-exploitation activity: Using Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory; Using 7-Zip to compress stolen data into ZIP files for exfiltration; Adding and using Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export mailbox data; Using the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine reverse shell; And downloading PowerCat from GitHub, then using it to open a connection to a remote server. The attackers were also able to download the Exchange offline address book from compromised systems, which contains information about an organization and its users, according to the analysis. \u201cThe good news for defenders is that the post-exploitation activity is very detectable,\u201d said Katie Nickels, director of intelligence at Red Canary, via email, adding her firm has detected numerous attacks as well. \u201cSome of the activity we observed uses the China Chopper web shell, which has been around for more than eight years, giving defenders ample time to develop detection logic for it.\u201d Who is the Hafnium APT? Hafnium has been tracked by Microsoft before, but the company has only just released a few details on the APT. In terms of its tactics, \u201cHafnium has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.\u201d Hafnium operates primarily from leased virtual private servers in the United States, and primarily goes after U.S. targets, but is linked to the Chinese government, according to Microsoft. It characterizes the APT as \u201ca highly skilled and sophisticated actor.\u201d Time to Patch: Expect More Attacks Soon It should be noted that other researchers say they have seen these vulnerabilities being exploited by different threat actors targeting other regions, according to Narang. \u201cWe expect other threat actors to begin leveraging these vulnerabilities in the coming days and weeks, which is why it is critically important for organizations that use Exchange Server to apply these patches immediately,\u201d he added. And indeed, researchers at Huntress said they have discovered more than 100 web shells deployed across roughly 1,500 vulnerable servers (with antivirus and endpoint detection/recovery installed) and expect this number to keep rising. They\u2019re not alone. \u201cFireEye has observed these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild and we are actively working with several impacted organizations,\u201d Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and CTO at FireEye Mandiant, said via email. \u201cIn addition to patching as soon as possible, we recommend organizations also review their systems for evidence of exploitation that may have occurred prior to the deployment of the patches.\u201d : Government Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] Full dumps of email boxes, lateral movement and backdoors characterize sophisticated attacks by a Chinese APT \u2013 while more incidents spread like wildfire.

Zero-Day Security Bugs in Exchange Server \u201cThe fact that Microsoft chose to patch these flaws out-of-band rather than include them as part of next week\u2019s Patch Tuesday release leads us to believe the flaws are quite severe even if we don\u2019t know the full scope of those attacks,\u201d Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, said via email. Microsoft patched following bugs this week, and admins should update accordingly: CVE-2021-26855 is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability that allows authentication bypass: A remote attacker can simply send arbitrary HTTP requests to the Exchange server and be able to authenticate to it. From there, an attacker can steal the full contents of multiple user mailboxes. CVE-2021-26857 is an insecure-deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service, where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. An exploit allows remote attackers with administrator permissions to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. CVE-2021-26858 and CVE-2021-27065 are both post-authentication arbitrary file-write vulnerabilities in Exchange. Once authenticated with an Exchange server (using CVE-2021-26855 or with compromised admin credentials), an attacker could write a file to any path on the server \u2013 thus achieving remote code execution (RCE). Researchers at Volexity originally uncovered the SSRF bug as part of an incident response and noted, \u201cThis vulnerability is remotely exploitable and does not require authentication of any kind, nor does it require any special knowledge or access to a target environment. The attacker only needs to know the server running Exchange and the account from which they want to extract email.\u201d They also observed the SSRF bug being chained with CVE-2021-27065 to accomplish RCE in multiple attacks. In addition to Volexity, Microsoft credited security researchers at Dubex with uncovering the recent activity, which was first observed in January. \u201cBased on what we know so far, exploitation of one of the four vulnerabilities requires no authentication whatsoever and can be used to potentially download messages from a targeted user\u2019s mailbox,\u201d said Tenable\u2019s Narang. \u201cThe other vulnerabilities can be chained together by a determined threat actor to facilitate a further compromise of the targeted organization\u2019s network.\u201d What Happened in the Hafnium Attacks? In the observed campaigns, the four zero-day bugs were used to gain initial access to targeted Exchange servers and achieve RCE. Hafnium operators then deployed web shells on the compromised servers, which were used to steal data and expand the attack, according to researchers. \u201cIn all cases of RCE, Volexity has observed the attacker writing webshells (ASPX files) to disk and conducting further operations to dump credentials, add user accounts, steal copies of the Active Directory database (NTDS.DIT) and move laterally to other systems and environments,\u201d according to Volexity\u2019s writeup. Following web shell deployment, Microsoft found that Hafnium operators performed a range of post-exploitation activity: Using Procdump to dump the LSASS process memory; Using 7-Zip to compress stolen data into ZIP files for exfiltration; Adding and using Exchange PowerShell snap-ins to export mailbox data; Using the Nishang Invoke-PowerShellTcpOneLine reverse shell; And downloading PowerCat from GitHub, then using it to open a connection to a remote server. The attackers were also able to download the Exchange offline address book from compromised systems, which contains information about an organization and its users, according to the analysis. \u201cThe good news for defenders is that the post-exploitation activity is very detectable,\u201d said Katie Nickels, director of intelligence at Red Canary, via email, adding her firm has detected numerous attacks as well. \u201cSome of the activity we observed uses the China Chopper web shell, which has been around for more than eight years, giving defenders ample time to develop detection logic for it.\u201d Who is the Hafnium APT? Hafnium has been tracked by Microsoft before, but the company has only just released a few details on the APT. In terms of its tactics, \u201cHafnium has previously compromised victims by exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing servers, and has used legitimate open-source frameworks, like Covenant, for command and control,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cOnce they\u2019ve gained access to a victim network, HAFNIUM typically exfiltrates data to file sharing sites like MEGA.\u201d Hafnium operates primarily from leased virtual private servers in the United States, and primarily goes after U.S. targets, but is linked to the Chinese government, according to Microsoft. It characterizes the APT as \u201ca highly skilled and sophisticated actor.\u201d Time to Patch: Expect More Attacks Soon It should be noted that other researchers say they have seen these vulnerabilities being exploited by different threat actors targeting other regions, according to Narang. \u201cWe expect other threat actors to begin leveraging these vulnerabilities in the coming days and weeks, which is why it is critically important for organizations that use Exchange Server to apply these patches immediately,\u201d he added. And indeed, researchers at Huntress said they have discovered more than 100 web shells deployed across roughly 1,500 vulnerable servers (with antivirus and endpoint detection/recovery installed) and expect this number to keep rising. They\u2019re not alone. \u201cFireEye has observed these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild and we are actively working with several impacted organizations,\u201d Charles Carmakal, senior vice president and CTO at FireEye Mandiant, said via email. \u201cIn addition to patching as soon as possible, we recommend organizations also review their systems for evidence of exploitation that may have occurred prior to the deployment of the patches.\u201d : Government Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer </s>"

"Apple said on Wednesday that it will rush an emergency patch to users that fixes an embarrassing login bug in its High Sierra operating system. Apple said on Wednesday that it will rush an emergency patch to users that fixes an embarrassing login bug in its High Sierra operating system. The patch is expected to be pushed out by Apple sometime Wednesday, according to a company spokesperson. The serious High Sierra login bug surfaced Tuesday, giving anyone with physical access to a computer running the latest version of the operating system admin access simply by putting “root” in the user name field. “This security issue appears to be both an unsecured default setting that shipped with the MacOS release and a flaw in the functionality of the software component that prevents one from disabling the root account,” said Chris Carlson, VP of product management at Qualys.  “The mitigation, until Apple releases a patch, is to create a secure password for the root account.” In a statement issued Wednesday, Apple admitted to the mistake stating, “Security is a top priority for every Apple product, and regrettably we stumbled with this release of macOS.” The statement continued: “When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. This morning, as of 8 a.m., the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of macOS High Sierra.” Developer Lemi Orhan Ergin is credited for first publicizing the Apple bug when he took to Twitter yesterday to publicize the flaw in for users running the latest macOS 10.13 version of the High Sierra operating system. Apple continued, in a rare admission of letting its customers down. “We greatly regret this error and we apologize to all Mac users, both for releasing with this vulnerability and for the concern it has caused. Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again,” the Apple spokesperson said. The vulnerability CVE-2017-13872 is identified by Apple in a security update as “a logic error existed in the validation of credentials. This was addressed with improved credential validation.” Impacted is macOS High Sierra 10.13.1. Versions of macOS Sierra 10.12.6 and earlier are not impacted by the bug, Apple said. Affected systems, Apple said, may allow an attacker to “bypass administrator authentication without supplying the administrator’s password.” Apple has recently come under scrutiny for obvious bugs found in the High Sierra operating system. In October, Apple rushed out an emergency patch that fixed another major bug (CVE-2017-7149) in its High Sierra operating system that revealed APFS volume passwords via the password hint feature. “We are seeing some pretty serious missteps here where Apple has shipped an operating system with some pretty bad security issues,” said Patrick Wardle, director of research with Synack in an interview with Threatpost Tuesday. “Any operating system is going to have its share of flaws, but these kinds of bugs look like Apple didn’t even test them. These are not very difficult bugs to trigger.” Wardle told Threatpost the implications of this bug are far reaching and go beyond simply gaining access to the local computer. For starters, he said attackers could use the flaw in conjunction with malware to elevate privileges locally to make changes to a system and add applications such as a keylogger. For systems on a corporate network, if a macOS computer has screen sharing enabled a remote attacker who is on the same network could under certain circumstances also use this bug to attack the targeted system remotely and gain root privileges. : Hacks Privacy Vulnerabilities","T1021 Remote Services,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery","<s>[INST] Apple said on Wednesday that it will rush an emergency patch to users that fixes an embarrassing login bug in its High Sierra operating system.

"The University of Texas information security office disclosed details of a vulnerability in remote management software Webmin that could allow someone to remotely delete files on a host server. The University of Texas information security office yesterday disclosed the details on a critical vulnerability in Webmin that was patched in May, days after it was reported. The bug in the UNIX remote management tool provided remote root access to a host server. Authenticated users would then be able to delete files stored on the server. Researcher John Gordon published a report yesterday on the UT ISO website explaining that the problem was discovered in the cron module’s new environment variable. Gordon wrote that an attacker would have been able to use directory traversal and null byte injection techniques to force Webmin to delete any file stored on the system. Directory traversal attacks are particularly dangerous because an attacker can remotely execute commands outside a root directory into sub-directories that should not be reachable online. “The obvious impact that comes to mind is denial of service or data loss, deleting files critical to the operation of the server such as /etc/passwd,” Gordon said. The vulnerability was reported on May 14 to Webmin, which released a patch on the same day to its Github page. On May 20, Webmin 1.690 was released and included the patch. The vulnerability, Gordon said, likely cannot be flipped into an attack granting someone remote shell access or code execution. The vulnerability, Gordon said, likely cannot be flipped into an attack granting someone remote shell access or code execution on a standard Linux server, for example, “In site-specific scenarios it may be possible to use this vulnerability to further compromise the server. For example, if a server uses Apache’s .htaccess files to control access to certain areas of a site, an attacker can now delete those .htaccess files and access those areas freely,” he said. “Another example is deleting stored iptables firewall rules so that the next time it was restarted the firewall rules would no longer be in effect.” For an exploit of this vulnerability to work, Gordon said an attacker would need valid credentials at any permission level so long as the cron module is accessible. “Webmin does referrer checks and denies most direct requests to pages unless they originated from another page on the same site, so we can’t just turn the attack into a simple link (GET request) that attackers or victims can click,” Gordon said. “It works as a POST request by keeping the referrer field intact and just changing the user field, but that requires a web proxy tool which adds slightly to the difficulty.” The ability to delete files, Gordon said, is a side effect of how Webmin keeps track of which files are in use. Adding an environment variable for a user, the username is used as part of a file name and adds a /path/to/filename.lock extension to indicate when it’s in use, he said. “Due to a lack of sanitization in the request, we’re able to modify our username to include ../../ characters to control which directory the file is in, and a null byte (%00) at the end to terminate the string,” Gordon said. “Webmin creates the .lock file, keeps track of it, and deletes the .lock file when it’s done. Our null byte keeps the ‘.lock’ part from being added, meaning Webmin is keeping track of the real filename, so when it’s time to clean up the .lock files, it deletes the legitimate file (e.g. ../../../../../etc/passwd).” Gordon was clear that an attacker could not take advantage of the vulnerability to drop malware into a directory, for example. “The vulnerability only allows you to delete files,” Gordon said. “There may be certain files in a Linux file system you could delete that would then give you an advantage in further compromising it like a file owned by root inside a directory that you have write access to, so that you could replace the file as a lesser user and control the file’s contents.

"There’s an entirely new attack surface in Exchange, a researcher revealed at Black Hat, and threat actors are now exploiting servers vulnerable to the RCE bugs. Researchers’ Microsoft Exchange server honeypots are being actively exploited via ProxyShell: The name of an attack disclosed at Black Hat last week that chains three vulnerabilities to enable unauthenticated attackers to perform remote code execution (RCE) and snag plaintext passwords. In his Black Hat presentation last week, Devcore principal security researcher Orange Tsai said that a survey shows more than 400,000 Exchange servers on the internet that are exposed to the attack via port 443. On Monday, the SANS Internet Storm Center’s Jan Kopriva reported that he found more than 30,000 vulnerable Exchange servers via a Shodan scan and that any threat actor worthy of that title would find it a snap to pull off, given how much information is available. Going by calculations tweeted by security researcher Kevin Beaumont, this means that, between ProxyLogon and ProxyShell, “just under 50 percent of internet-facing Exchange servers” are currently vulnerable to exploitation, according to a Shodan search.

Mail server is both a highly valuable asset and a seemingly irresistible target for attackers, given that it holds businesses’ confidential secrets and corporate data. “In other words, controlling a mail server means controlling the lifeline of a company,” Tsai explained. “As the most common-use email solution, Exchange Server has been the top target for hackers for a long time. Based on our research, there are more than four hundred thousands Exchange Servers exposed on the Internet. Each server represents a company, and you can imagine how horrible it is while a severe vulnerability appeared in Exchange Server.” During his Black Hat presentation, Tsai explained that the new attack surface his team discovered is based on “a significant change in Exchange Server 2013, where the fundamental protocol handler, Client Access Service (CAS), splits into frontend and backend” – a change that incurred “quite an amount of design” and yielded eight vulnerabilities, consisting of server-side bugs, client-side bugs and crypto bugs. He chained the bugs into three attack vectors: The now-infamous ProxyLogon that induced patching frenzy a few months back, the ProxyShell vector that’s now under active attack, and another vector called ProxyOracle. “These attack vectors enable any unauthenticated attacker to uncover plaintext passwords and even execute arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Servers through port 443, which is exposed to the Internet by about 400,000 Exchange Servers,” according to the presentation’s introduction. The three Exchange vulnerabilities, all of which are patched, that Tsai chained for the ProxyShell attack: CVE-2021-34473 – Pre-auth path confusion leads to ACL bypass CVE-2021-34523 – Elevation of privilege on Exchange PowerShell backend CVE-2021-31207 – Post-auth arbitrary file-write leads to RCE ProxyShell earned the Devcore team a $200,000 bounty after they used the bugs to take over an Exchange server at the Pwn2Own 2021 contest in April. During his Black Hat talk, Tsai said that he discovered the Exchange vulnerabilities when targeting the Microsoft Exchange CAS attack surface. As Tsai explained, CAS is “a fundamental component” of Exchange. He referred to Microsoft’s documentation, which states: “Mailbox servers contain the Client Access services that accept client connections for all protocols. These frontend services are responsible for routing or proxying connections to the corresponding backend services on a Mailbox server.” “From the narrative you could realize the importance of CAS, and you could imagine how critical it is when bugs are found in such infrastructure. CAS was where we focused on, and where the attack surface appeared,” Tsai wrote. “CAS is the fundamental component in charge of accepting all the connections from the client side, no matter if it’s HTTP, POP3, IMAP or SMTP, and proxies the connections to the corresponding backend service.” ProxyShell Just the ‘Tip of the Iceberg’ Out of all the bugs he found in the new attack surface, Tsai dubbed CVE-2020-0688 (an RCE vulnerability that involved a hard-coded cryptographic key in Exchange) the “most surprising.” “With this hard-coded key, an attacker with low privilege can take over the whole Exchange Server,” he wrote. “And as you can see, even in 2020, a silly, hard-coded cryptographic key could still be found in an essential software like Exchange. This indicated that Exchange is lacking security reviews, which also inspired me to dig more into the Exchange security.” But the “most interesting” flaw is CVE-2018-8581, he said, which was disclosed by someone who cooperated with ZDI. Though it’s a “simple” server-side request forgery (SSRF), it could be combined with NTLM Relay, enabling the attacker to “turn a boring SSRF into something really fancy,” Tsai said. For example, it could “directly control the whole Domain Controller through a low-privilege account,” Tsai said. Autodiscover Figures into ProxyShell As BleepingComputer reported, during his presentation, Tsai explained that one of the components of the ProxyShell attack chain targets the Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover service: a service that eases configuration and deployment by providing clients access to Exchange features with minimal user input. Tsai’s talk evidently triggered a wave of scanning for the vulnerabilities by attackers. After watching the presentation, other security researchers replicated the ProxyShell exploit. The day after Tsai’s presentation, last Friday, PeterJson and Nguyen Jang published more detailed technical information about their successful reproduction of the exploit. Soon after, Beaumont tweeted about a threat actor who was probing his Exchange honeypot using the Autodiscover service.

"Reading Time: 2 minutes We have been very proud of the performance of Comodo Internet Security in the Matousec.com “Proactive Internet Security Challenge 64” over the past year. It’s worth taking some time to explain why this matters. A great resource for Internet security pros are Matousec and their website Matousec.com. They are an independent project run by security experts dedicated to improving end user security. They not only do testing and research, they have worked with vendors to introduced innovative Internet security solutions. According to their web site “We want to participate in the global security research, provide independent software testing, support other companies and software vendors with similar orientation in their activities, and help with the development of their security products.” The Matousec Challenge One of the most interesting projects that Matousec engages in is called the Matousec Proactive  Internet Security Challenge.  It is an ongoing test of 38 internet security suites for Microsoft Windows computers.  Each of the 38 have been tested within the past 6 months. What was so challenging about “The Challenge”? They wouldn’t call it a “Challenge” unless it very was demanding.  The tests are organized into a series of increasingly difficult levels to pass.  The software must pass one level to proceed to the next. The tests come from 6 categories of tests: Leak-test: Tests that try to send data to the Internet server. Spying test: These tests typically use Keylogger and packet sniffer software to attempt to spy on users’ input or data. Autorun test: These tests determine if test software can download, install itself and survive the computer being rebooted. Self-defense test: This refers to a group of tests that attempt to shut down or damage the security itself. Other: Miscellaneous tests that do not fit into the other categories. The tests are conducted on virtual Windows 7/Vista machines under Administrative rights with the User Account Control (UAC) turned off. Matousec’s research indicates that this is the most common real world configuration. What’s the score? You can view the current rankings an all of the details at Matousec.com, but the following is the top 5 as of this publication. 1)         Comodo Internet Security Premium 6.0.260739.2674 2)         Privatefirewall 7.0.28.1 3)         Kaspersky Internet Security 2013 13.0.1.4190 4)         Outpost Security Suite Pro 7.5.2.3939.602.1809 5)         SpyShelter Firewall 1.5 Comodo was the only suite to receive a rating of “Excellent” and only one of three products that Matousec rated as “Recommended”!

"Siemens fixed a session hijacking vulnerability in its LOGO! logic module Wednesday but says a second issue, one that could help facilitate a man-in-the-middle attack, has no fix currently. Administrators who have Siemens’ LOGO! logic module deployed in automation setups are being urged to update its firmware. The German industrial manufacturing giant pushed out an update for its LOGO! 8 BM devices Wednesday morning to fix a vulnerability (CVE-2017-12734) that could let an attacker hijack existing web sessions. The vulnerability affects all versions of the module prior to V1.81.2. LOGO! is a universal logic module designed for use in small-scale automation projects. It’s commonly used in domestic and installation engineering setups, gate control systems, air conditioning systems, and rainwater pumps. The module can also communicate with SIMATIC HMI and S7 systems. The vulnerability, discovered by Maxim Rupp, an independent security researcher based in Germany, could allow an attacker with network access to the integrated web server on port 80/TCP to obtain the session ID of an active session user as long as that user is logged into the web interface. While admins should pay attention to the firmware update and apply it to fix the vulnerability, more concerning is that there’s a second issue (CVE-2017-12735) that plagues the logic module which has not been fixed. The second issue could let an attacker carry out a man-in-the-middle attack between LOGO! and other devices and potentially allow them to decrypt and modify network traffic, according to a security advisory (.PDF) issued by the company’s ProductCERT team Wednesday. Siemens is urging admins to apply four mitigations to thwart exploitation of the second vulnerability: Configure the environment according to the recommendations in the user manual Apply cell protection concept Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells Apply Defense-in-Depth It’s unclear if Siemens plans to fix the vulnerability that could lead to a man-in-the-middle attack. The company did not immediately return a request for comment on Wednesday, but said in its advisory it strongly recommends users protect network access to the devices with appropriate mechanisms. Siemens warned of vulnerabilities in several other products on Wednesday, including a denial of service vulnerability in its 7KM PAC Switched Ethernet PROFINET expansion modules, and scores of industrial products vulnerable to remote resource consumption attacks. The remote resource consumption attacks could be caused if an attacker sent a collection of specially crafted packets to a server used by the products, OPC Discovery. If successful the system could access various resources chosen by the attacker. Patches exist but until deployed a number of SIMATIC devices, PCS 7, WinCC, WinCC Runtime Professional, NET PC Software, and IT Production Suite, are all vulnerable, Siemens warns (.PDF). Sergey Temnikov, a senior research developer at Kaspersky Lab’s ICS-CERT, discovered the attack vector and responsibly disclosed it to the company.

"The Variation Swatches plugin security flaw lets attackers with low-level permissions tweak important settings on e-commerce sites to inject malicious scripts. The plugin “Variation Swatches for WooCommerce,” installed across 80,000 WordPress-powered retail sites, contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) security vulnerability that could allow cyberattackers to inject malicious web scripts and take over sites. Variation Swatches is designed to allow retailers using the WooCommerce platform for WordPress sites to show different versions of the same product, like a sweater in several colors. Unfortunately, vulnerable versions can also give users without administrative permissions — like customers or subscribers — access to the plugin’s settings, according to researchers from Wordfence. “More specifically, the plugin registered the ‘tawcvs_save_settings,’ ‘update_attribute_type_setting’ and ‘update_product_attr_type’ functions, which were all hooked to various AJAX actions,” Wordfence’s Chloe Chamberland explained, in a Wednesday posting. “These three functions were all missing capability checks as well as nonce checks, which provide cross-site request forgery protection.” Giving low-permissioned users access to the “tawcvs_save_settings” function is particularly concerning, she said, because that access can be used to update the plugin’s settings and inject malicious web scripts that would execute whenever a site owner accessed the settings area of the plugin. “As always, malicious web scripts can be crafted to inject new administrative user accounts or even modify a plugin or theme file to include a backdoor, which in turn would grant the attacker the ability to completely take over a site,” the researcher added. The vulnerability (CVE-2021-42367) affected all users of the plugin until Nov. 23, when it was patched in the new 2.1.2 version. WordPress Users Plagued by Problems WordPress users are already grappling with cascading bugs, incidents and compromises. Last week for instance, GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, was breached — affecting 1.2 million customers along with various resellers of GoDaddy Managed WordPress. In mid-Nov. another glitchy WordPress plugin let attackers display a fake ransomware encryption message demanding about $6,000 to unlock the site. The threat was empty, all the users needed to do was delete the plugin, but had the attackers deployed actual ransomware the outcome could have been catastrophic. And in late October, a WordPress plugin bug was discovered in the Hashthemes Demo Importer offering, that allowed users with simple subscriber permissions to wipe sites of all content. To mitigate this latest plugin bug, Chamberland recommends  that users update their sites with the patched version of the Variation Swatches for WooCommerce.

Unfortunately, vulnerable versions can also give users without administrative permissions — like customers or subscribers — access to the plugin’s settings, according to researchers from Wordfence. “More specifically, the plugin registered the ‘tawcvs_save_settings,’ ‘update_attribute_type_setting’ and ‘update_product_attr_type’ functions, which were all hooked to various AJAX actions,” Wordfence’s Chloe Chamberland explained, in a Wednesday posting. “These three functions were all missing capability checks as well as nonce checks, which provide cross-site request forgery protection.” Giving low-permissioned users access to the “tawcvs_save_settings” function is particularly concerning, she said, because that access can be used to update the plugin’s settings and inject malicious web scripts that would execute whenever a site owner accessed the settings area of the plugin. “As always, malicious web scripts can be crafted to inject new administrative user accounts or even modify a plugin or theme file to include a backdoor, which in turn would grant the attacker the ability to completely take over a site,” the researcher added. The vulnerability (CVE-2021-42367) affected all users of the plugin until Nov. 23, when it was patched in the new 2.1.2 version. WordPress Users Plagued by Problems WordPress users are already grappling with cascading bugs, incidents and compromises. Last week for instance, GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registrar, was breached — affecting 1.2 million customers along with various resellers of GoDaddy Managed WordPress. In mid-Nov. another glitchy WordPress plugin let attackers display a fake ransomware encryption message demanding about $6,000 to unlock the site. The threat was empty, all the users needed to do was delete the plugin, but had the attackers deployed actual ransomware the outcome could have been catastrophic. And in late October, a WordPress plugin bug was discovered in the Hashthemes Demo Importer offering, that allowed users with simple subscriber permissions to wipe sites of all content. To mitigate this latest plugin bug, Chamberland recommends  that users update their sites with the patched version of the Variation Swatches for WooCommerce.

"WordPress has issued a security release, patching a SOME vulnerability in Plupload, and a reflected cross-site scripting bug in MediaElement.js. WordPress vulnerabilities continue to be a magnet for hackers laden with exploit kits, and as recently as February, crippling ransomware attacks. As a result, WordPress has already released three security updates this year, the latest for the content management system coming last Friday, bringing current users to version 4.5.2. WordPress also in April turned on free encryption for custom domains hosted on the platform. The latest update is a security release affecting all versions including 4.5.1. In an advisory published late last week, WordPress said the Plupload third-party file-upload library was plagued by a SOME vulnerability. SOME flaws are Same Origin Method Execution bugs where JSON callbacks are abused and lead to similar problems as cross-site scripting attacks. Researcher Ben Hayak presented on SOME flaws at Black Hat Europe two years ago and he provides some technical details in a blog post. The WordPress update also patches a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in MediaElement.js. This is a third-party library used for media players, WordPress said, adding that it affects only WordPress 4.2 through 4.5.1. WordPress said the update is available via download, or through the admin Dashboard under Updates. WordPress also issued a notice about the recently disclosed ImageMagick vulnerabilities, advising self-hosted WordPress sites to patch immediately. The flaws are being attacked publicly and can lead to remote code execution in some cases. ImageMagick is open-source image-processing software that is used by a number of plugins in PHP, Ruby and nodeJS among many others, increasing the exposure of affected sites running the software significantly.

"A number of families of malicious programs became noticeably more active last month. Net-Worm.Win32.Mytob was one of these, and in May it started to present a serious challenge to Email-Worm.Win32.Mydoom. It may be that in the near future Mytob, which is a direct descendant of Mydoom (with added functionality) will be come more prevalent than Mydoom. This is because Mytob’s extended functionality makes it capable of propagating via networks. It also contains an IRC backdoor, and some versions of Mytob are capable of propagating via IM networks: these versions include a separate module which is effectively a clone of IM-Worm.Win32.Kelvir. This is installed separately to the victim machine by the main executable file of the malicious program. It should be noticed that in addition to extended functionalities, the life-cycle of Mytob is also changing. In contrast to the most recent, short lived email worms, Mytob is designed to be active for longer, similar to the first versions of Mydoom, NetSKy, Zafi and Bagle. All the modifications listed above, together with the new versions which are regularly released, and recompiled, make the worm highly prevalent.The next worm on the list worth examining is Eyeveg, for a variety of reasons. In May, after nearly six months in hibernation, Eyeveg became extremely active again. The first three versions of this worm were detected in 2003 (the last one on the 14th October), with another two being detected in 2004. And then, this month, Eyeveg.f, Eyeveg.g and Eyeveg.h appeared, with approximately a week’s lapse between versions. It’s currently one of the most active malicious programs, with the majority of activity being in the Russian Federation. It’s difficult to predict what will happen in the future. Maybe the worm will retreat again after this burst of frenzied activity, or continue to spread, and maintain its current level of activity, as some other programs – Trojan-Downloader.Win32.INService, for example – have done.Finally, Email-Worm.Win32.Sober made another appearance, as Sober.q, which spread actively throughout Europe, sending far right propaganda and updating itself (to Sober.p) via the Internet.IM worms remain active, with new versions appearing frequently – IM-Worm.Win32.Bropia and IM-Worm.Win32.Kelvir have been detected in a number of versions. New versions are characterized by their short life cycle.In contrast to worms, spyware has been less active this month. However, the decreased activity is not particularly significant, and mainly applies to Trojan-PSW.Win32.LdPinch, PdPinch and Trojan-Spy.Win32.Goldun. In fact, the decreased activity is simply a drop from an extremely high peak to a more standard level.On the other hand, within this same group of programs, Brazilian spyware has become far more prevalent, both the spyware itself and the downloader programs which install it. Every day we see either a new version of one of these programs, or a modified old version – older versions are modified in order to make it more difficult for antivirus solutions to detect them. One example of this approach is Trojan-Spy.Win32.Baner.ju, which constantly arrives in slightly different guises.Spyware spreads in a number of ways, with the most popular method being mass mailing (spamming). This can be done in a variety of ways, either in a single stage (where the file containing the spyware is mailed to the user) or in two stages, using a Trojan downloader (in the case of this spyware family, Dadobra is used. Some recent versions of Dadobra have been modified to download files containing other malicious programs via FTP, rather than using HTTP as in the past.) One other method, which is used relatively infrequently, is using Email-Worm.Win32.Combra as the carrier; this worm will download either the spyware program itself or the Trojan downloader to the infected machine.May was also notable for the Chinese attempting to compete with the Brazilians in terms of virus activity. However, Chinese programs such as Trojan-PSW.Win32.Lmir, Lineage, Gamania and other QQ (Chinese instant messaging application) malware have not shown any significantly increased activity. Backdoor.Win32.Hupigon is something of an exception here, as several new versions have been released in the recent past, but they have not caused any serious disruption.Finally, an interesting newcomer this month was Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Peerat.a, which is distinguished by its functionality. It differs from standard Trojan downloaders in that it doesn’t just download other malicious programs to the victim machine, but also to any file sharing network present.To summarize: Mytob became more active than Mydoom, its predecessor, and this trend looks set to continue.

"Security researcher Jordan Wiens was awarded one million miles after submitting a remote code execution bug to United Airlines’ bug bounty program. Poking about a United Airlines online property might not seem to be the wisest course of action for a professional hacker given the fallout over the Chris Roberts saga, but Jordan Wiens insists he wasn’t deterred. Wiens, who founded a security company in Florida called Vector 35 and not too long ago worked for a government contractor, submitted what he thought were a couple of “lame” bugs to United’s two-month-old bug bounty program—his first commercial bounty submission. The payoff was anything but weak. Last Friday, Wiens was awarded one million miles for a remote code execution vulnerability, United’s highest payout and the first of its kind; United’s bug bounty is the first for a major airline. United’s bounty was announced shortly after the incident with Roberts, who tweeted during a flight that he had access to the aircraft’s in-flight entertainment system. Roberts was questioned by the FBI, who allegedly said Roberts told investigators he took control of the airplane and caused it to climb and turn. Wiens, who is bound by the rules of the bounty not to share details on the vulnerability he found, said he wasn’t particularly worried about the ramifications of the Roberts incident on his work. “[United] put out the bounty, which means they clearly want help,” Wiens said. “I didn’t have to test for the remote code execution bugs. I was passively poking the site and being careful about how much I was tampering. There wasn’t a whole lot of aggressive testing that I had to do. I knew I was in the clear.” Remote code execution bugs are one of 10 bug classes eligible for bounties under United’s program; others include authentication bypass vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities on customer-facing websites and the United mobile app, cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, information disclosure, timing and brute-force attacks. Bugs on internal sites, partner sites and apps, on-board Wi-Fi, entertainment and avionics systems are out of scope. United offers bounty winners only miles as a payout, with 50,00 awarded for XSS and CSRF bugs, 250,000 for authentication bypass, brute force attacks, PII disclosures and timing attacks, and one million miles for remote code execution bugs. “There were actually two bugs that I submitted that I were pretty sure were remote code execution, but I also thought they were lame and wasn’t sure if they were on parts of the infrastructure that qualified,” Wiens said. “My expectation was that they counted, but I figured they’d award me 50,000 miles or something smaller.” Instead, he got a message from United asking him to confirm his U.S. citizenship and whether the research was done on U.S. soil. “I was hoping this wasn’t a honeypot,” Wiens joked. “Two hours later, I got a message to check my account that I had gotten my million miles. “Give [United] credit,” he said. “Not a lot of companies that are not tech companies have a bug bounty program.” Wiens said he’s done a number of permutations on what one million miles are worth and what he can do with them. As for monetary value, it’s around $25,000, which is a better payout than most commercial bug bounties. Wiens figures he has a number of options that range from using most of the miles on a first-class around-the-world trip to breaking them down to 40 domestic round-trip flights. In the meantime, Wiens said he won’t disclose any details that would put the winnings in jeopardy. “The best details I can share is that it was a remote code execution bug, and I didn’t have to test it to know it was remote code execution,” Wiens said, adding that it took him about six hours of work. “Finding the right domain and area to poke at was the interesting part. “I never submit to bounties,” he said. “I’ve done a lot of vulnerability research, but always on my own, never public bug bounties before.

"French researcher Kafeine has found an exploit kit delivering cross-site request forgery attacks that focus on SOHO routers and changing DNS settings to redirect to malicious sites. Attacks targeting small office and home router DNS settings, long a target for network intruders seeking to redirect web traffic to malicious sites, have for the first time been included in an exploit kit—one that specializes in cross-site request forgery attacks. An exploit kit has been spotted by French researcher Kafeine, who on Friday published research about the attacks. At its peak on May 9—after a month-long series of modifications from the attackers that included better JavaScript obfuscation—traffic from the campaign peaked at almost a million hits, Kafeine said. The attackers are driving a lot of traffic from Chrome users in particular, Kafeine said. Such pharming attacks are particularly dangerous—and have targeted home routers before—putting online banking and other sensitive transactions and communication at risk. The researcher said he hasn’t been able to determine the extent of any damage, but given the state of router vulnerability management, it could be a gold mine. “There are fresh exploits inside, and if a user already has trouble updating their software, we can guess router update is not something people are doing,” Kafeine said. “This kind of attack is really old, but yes [this is the] first time I’ve seen something with obfuscation, rotating domains and landing going after DNS.” Researchers at Kaspersky Lab published a report in September on similar web-based attacks against routers taking place in Brazil. Rather than exploit kits, the attackers relied on phishing emails and malicious websites to push code that change home router DNS settings and point them toward phishing websites for some of Brazil’s largest banks in an attempt to steal credentials. “This is something I hadn’t seen in the attacks I was researching. But this was expected: put everything together in a exploit kit is a natural movement from bad guys, as we see an avalanche of vulnerabilities in network devices that allows CSRF,” said Kaspersky Lab researcher Fabio Assolini of Kafeine’s findings. Assolini, who lives in Brazil, said hackers in his country are beginning to move in this direction as well in terms of using CSRF attacks, but he has yet to see exploit kits or heavy JavaScript obfuscation. “I think the worst scenario is related to attacks that use (remote code execution), exploiting these vulnerabilities to change DNS remotely, as there are a lot of devices that are outdated,” Assolini said, adding that a separate attack in 2011 in Brazil compromised more than four million devices. SOHO routers are infected in this campaign via drive-by download attacks and malvertising on popular websites. The attackers’ concentration on Chrome and Chromium users could be because of their ability to discover local and public IP addresses using tools such as one developed by Daniel Roesler called WebRTC-ips. WebRTC is present in Chrome—and Firefox—and allows browsers and mobile apps to communicate in real time via APIs. Roesler’s tool takes advantage of the fact that WebRTC allows requests to STUN servers (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) that will return IP information. These use of such requests, Kafeine said, allows an attacker to avoid having to launch noisy shotgun-style attacks. Kafeine explained in a post on his website that he first spotted the attacks in April, expecting at the outset for the payload to be ransomware; instead he saw a cross-site request forgery and related pharming attacks. CSRF attacks force victims to submit malicious requests on the attackers’ behalf, usually on sites where the victim is already logged in. Kafeine said the original exploit was written in the clear, but inside of a month, had already added obfuscation to the mix among many improvements. The code included a long list of routers to target from popular vendors, including D-Link, Belkin, Asus, Linksys, Netgear and others. In one example from Kafeine where he “posed” as a vulnerable router, it was hit with an exploit for a recent D-Link command injection vulnerability (CVE-2015-1187), which was made public and patched March 2. “I guess this attack is pretty effective (the percentage of routers updated in the past two months is probably really low),” Kafeine wrote. In the attack, the DNS address was changed to 185[.]82[.]216[.]86; it has since been changed to 217[.]12[.]202[.93], and always uses Google’s DNS as a failover should the first IP fail, Kafeine said. A deeper look at the attack code, he said, revealed exploits for a CVE published in 2008 and another from 2013. “We can bet there are a lot more buried in the POST commands dedicated to some of the models,” he wrote. The risk to users is substantial he said, ranging from financial loss, to click-fraud, man-in-the-middle attacks and phishing. “That depend on what the bad guys’ plans are,” Kafeine said. “They can stealthily alter traffic of all computers in the perimeter, show ad-banners, do some phishing etc…” This article was updated to remove references to the Sweet Orange exploit kit. : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] French researcher Kafeine has found an exploit kit delivering cross-site request forgery attacks that focus on SOHO routers and changing DNS settings to redirect to malicious sites.

The attackers’ concentration on Chrome and Chromium users could be because of their ability to discover local and public IP addresses using tools such as one developed by Daniel Roesler called WebRTC-ips. WebRTC is present in Chrome—and Firefox—and allows browsers and mobile apps to communicate in real time via APIs. Roesler’s tool takes advantage of the fact that WebRTC allows requests to STUN servers (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) that will return IP information. These use of such requests, Kafeine said, allows an attacker to avoid having to launch noisy shotgun-style attacks. Kafeine explained in a post on his website that he first spotted the attacks in April, expecting at the outset for the payload to be ransomware; instead he saw a cross-site request forgery and related pharming attacks. CSRF attacks force victims to submit malicious requests on the attackers’ behalf, usually on sites where the victim is already logged in. Kafeine said the original exploit was written in the clear, but inside of a month, had already added obfuscation to the mix among many improvements. The code included a long list of routers to target from popular vendors, including D-Link, Belkin, Asus, Linksys, Netgear and others. In one example from Kafeine where he “posed” as a vulnerable router, it was hit with an exploit for a recent D-Link command injection vulnerability (CVE-2015-1187), which was made public and patched March 2. “I guess this attack is pretty effective (the percentage of routers updated in the past two months is probably really low),” Kafeine wrote. In the attack, the DNS address was changed to 185[.]82[.]216[.]86; it has since been changed to 217[.]12[.]202[.93], and always uses Google’s DNS as a failover should the first IP fail, Kafeine said. A deeper look at the attack code, he said, revealed exploits for a CVE published in 2008 and another from 2013. “We can bet there are a lot more buried in the POST commands dedicated to some of the models,” he wrote. The risk to users is substantial he said, ranging from financial loss, to click-fraud, man-in-the-middle attacks and phishing. “That depend on what the bad guys’ plans are,” Kafeine said. “They can stealthily alter traffic of all computers in the perimeter, show ad-banners, do some phishing etc…” This article was updated to remove references to the Sweet Orange exploit kit. : Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer </s>"
"The networking giant issued 27 patches impacting a wide range of its products running the ISO XE software. UDPATE Cisco Systems issued 24 patches Wednesday tied to vulnerabilities in its IOS XE operating system and warned customers that two small business  routers (RV320 and RV325) are vulnerable to attack and that no patches are available for either. A total of 19 of the bugs were rated high severity by Cisco, with the others rated medium. The two router vulnerabilities are rated high and are part of Cisco’s Dual Gigabit WAN VPN RV320 and RV325 line of small business routers. Both router flaws were first patched in January, however Cisco said on Wednesday that both patches were “incomplete” and that both routers were still vulnerable to attack. It added in both cases that, “firmware updates that address [these vulnerabilities] are not currently available.” It added there are no workarounds that address either vulnerability. One of the router flaws (CVE-2019-1652) is a command injection vulnerability “due to improper validation of user-supplied input,” Cisco wrote. The bug could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges on an affected device to execute arbitrary commands. The second router bug (CVE-2019-1653) is an information disclosure vulnerability also impacting Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 routers. “A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information,” Cisco wrote. IOS XE Bugs Of the high severity vulnerabilities 15 were tied to Cisco’s Internetworking Operating System (IOS) XE, which runs on Cisco networking gear such as its switches, controllers and routers. Bugs ranged from privilege escalation, injection and denial of service vulnerabilities. One bug (CVE-2019-1745) is a Cisco IOS XE software command injection vulnerability. According to Cisco, the vulnerability could be exploited by a local adversary that could inject arbitrary commands into the OS that are executed with elevated privileges. “The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands supplied by the user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device,” wrote Cisco. The two command injection patches (CVE-2019-1756, CVE-2019-1755) allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute commands on devices running the vulnerable Cisco IOS XE software. “The vulnerability occurs because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input. An attacker who has valid administrator access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a username with a malicious payload in the web UI and subsequently making a request to a specific endpoint in the web UI,” Cisco said of CVE-2019-1756. Four Critical Non-Cisco Bugs Also Reported As part of its flurry of patch announcements, Cisco also posted information regarding four vulnerabilities rated critical for non-Cisco products. The critical bugs include: Moodle mybackpack functionality server side request forgery vulnerability (CVE-2019-3809) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server side request forgery attack on a targeted system. A second critical vulnerability was found in Elastic Kibana Security Audit Logger that could lead to an arbitrary code execution (CVE-2019-7610).

"Researchers have unearthed more vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s IoT security solution. Details tied to a pair of remote code execution bugs in Microsoft’s IoT security platform called Azure Sphere were released Monday. Also made public were specifics associated with two additional privilege escalation flaws impacting the same cloud security platform. Public disclosure of all four of the bugs piggyback on six vulnerabilities found in July also impacting Microsoft’s Azure Sphere. Cybersecurity researchers at Cisco Talos found each of the bugs and released the technical details of the vulnerabilities only after Microsoft issued patches. “Cisco Talos worked with Microsoft to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers. However, Microsoft declined to issue any CVEs,” according to a research brief published Monday. Azure Sphere, which debuted at the RSA Conference 2018, is Redmond’s IoT security solution designed to secure microcontroller unit (MCU) devices typically found within IoT networks. The platform leverages MCUs with built-in security technology leveraging certificate-based authentication to protect against threats. The first of two code execution bugs disclosed on Monday is described as a “normal world application READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality unsigned code execution vulnerability“. The TDLR version of the bug, impacting Azure Sphere 20.06, is that specially crafted shellcode introduced into the platform can cause a process’ heap (data stored into memory) to become executable. For example, an “attacker can execute a shellcode that sets the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality to trigger this vulnerability,” according Cisco Talos. How severe is this vulnerability and the other remote code execution (RCE) bug? “Remote code execution vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise. They need to be taken very seriously and patched when possible. In the event a severe issue cannot be patched a layered mitigation strategy needs to be in place,” wrote Craig Williams, director Talos Outreach at Cisco, in an email interview. Reducing some concern is the fact that both the RCE bugs would be needed to be exploited locally and couldn’t be triggered outside the trusted Azure Sphere environment. “In our attack scenario we assume that an attacker has already gained a foothold on the device and is using these vulnerabilities in order to execute remote unsigned code which according to Microsoft’s security model is not something that should be possible,” Williams said. The second code execution vulnerability outlined by researchers impacts Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.07 and is based on the assumption a local attacker can introduce a compromised application into the IoT ecosystem. “A specially crafted shellcode can cause a process’ non-writable memory to be written. An attacker can execute a shellcode that modifies the program at runtime via /proc/thread-self/mem to trigger this vulnerability,” according to the Cisco Talos write-up. The vulnerability, according to researchers, can be exploited by an application that hides in Azure Sphere and executes a process within Microsoft’s custom Linux-based OS – part of Azure Sphere. “The scope of this issue is within an already compromised application,” researchers wrote. Pseudo-code, in this scenario, would be implemented via return oriented programming (ROP) gadgets. Pseudo-code is a way of writing programming code in plain English and is not actual programming language. ROP gadgets are discrete instruction sequences that can be chained together in an attack. “[The] sequence of commands overwrites the function pointed by func with an arbitrary shellcode, and could be used by an attacker to run unsigned code, after compromising an application,” researchers said. Cisco Talos researchers also disclosed two privilege escalation vulnerabilities, both rated high-severity and impacting Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.06. Both bugs are also patched. “A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Capability access control functionality,” wrote researchers. “A set of specially crafted ptrace syscalls can be used to obtain elevated capabilities. An attacker can write a shellcode to trigger this vulnerability.” Ptrace is jargon that describes a single system call and a system call is the action a computer program takes when requesting a service from the core of a computer’s operating system (kernel). “An attacker can use the ptrace API to gain execution in another Azure Sphere process and use its Azure Sphere capabilities to access an entirely new set of IOCTL (input/output control) requests,” Cisco Talos wrote. The second privilege escalation bug exploits a flaw in IoT devices and their unique identifier (UID) numbers. “A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the uid_map functionality of Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.06. A specially crafted uid_map file can cause multiple applications to get the same UID assigned, thus broadening the attack surface. An attacker can modify the uid_map file to trigger this vulnerability,” according to the writeup. Each of the bugs disclosed Monday are credited to Claudio Bozzato, Dave McDaniel and “Lilith >_>” of Cisco Talos.

"As part of Patch Tuesday Adobe patched a zero-day vulnerability in Flash Player the company claims is being used in targeted attacks against Internet Explorer users on Windows. Adobe patched 31 vulnerabilities across nine different product lines Tuesday morning, including a zero-day vulnerability in Flash Player the company claims is being used in targeted attacks against Internet Explorer users on Windows. That vulnerability (CVE-2016-7892) is one of 16 bugs in Flash that could lead to code execution if exploited. Currently, little is known about the exploit – it was anonymously reported – other than the fact that it’s a use-after-free vulnerability and that it’s being used in limited, targeted attacks against users running the 32-bit version of IE on Windows, according to a security bulletin issued by the Adobe Tuesday. Users running any affected versions (11.2.202.644 and 23.0.0.207 and prior) using Flash Player for Linux are encouraged to update to the new version ( 24.0.0.186) as soon as possible. Today’s Flash zero-day is one of four critical vulnerabilities fixed by Adobe this month. The company also issued updates to address memory corruption vulnerabilities in Animate, a computer animation program it produces, DNG Converter, a free DNG conversion utility it distributes, and InDesign, its desktop publishing platform. While the company said it wasn’t aware that any of those vulnerabilities were being exploited in the wild, it is nevertheless encouraging users to update to the latest Animate version (16.0.0.112), the latest DNG Converter version (9.8) and the latest InDesign and InDesign server version (12.0.0) to mitigate risk. Adobe claims all three vulnerabilities are critical but gives each one a priority of three, meaning the products aren’t historically targets for attackers. Adobe also shipped patches for a handful of vulnerabilities it considers ‘important’ on Tuesday. Affected products include Experience Manager — part of its Marketing Cloud infrastructure, ColdFusion Builder, Digital Editions, and RoboHelp, a help authoring tool for Windows users. The vulnerabilities could be used in cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgery attacks, as well as lead to information disclosure, memory address leaks and other outcomes, according to Adobe. The update, part of the company’s regularly scheduled Patch Tuesday bulletins, comes a month after it patched nine code execution vulnerabilities in Flash Player. Unlike this month’s patches, none of November’s fixes resolved a publicly exploited flaw. It’s the second time Adobe has patched a Flash zero-day under attack this fall.

"Researchers warn customers to reconsider the use of the camera’s remote access feature if the device is monitoring highly sensitive areas of their household or company. D-Link has only partially patched critical flaws affecting its consumer WiFi camera, which allow hackers to intercept and view recorded video. They also allow attackers to manipulate the device’s firmware, according to security researchers. The camera in question is D-Link’s DCS-2132L cloud camera, popular with consumers and sold at big-box retailers and online. The most serious of the vulnerabilities  is one that creates conditions that are optimum for a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, according to ESET researchers who discovered the bugs late last year. The problem is tied to the lack of encryption in the transmission of the video stream between the camera and D-Link’s cloud service, and also from the cloud to the user’s client-side viewing app, researchers explained, in a Thursday report outlining the flaw.. “The viewer app and the camera communicate via a proxy server on port 2048, using a TCP tunnel based on a custom D-Link tunneling protocol,” wrote ESET researchers Milan Fránik and Miloš Čermák. “Unfortunately, only part of the traffic running through these tunnels is encrypted, leaving some of the most sensitive contents – such as the requests for camera IP and MAC addresses, version information, video and audio streams, and extensive camera info – without encryption.” The bug is further traced to D-Link’s use of customized open-source Boa web server source code. Boa is a small-footprint web server software, typically used with embedded applications — and it was discontinued in 2005. ESET said that because the D-Link Boa web server handles HTTP requests to the camera sans encryption, “all HTTP requests from 127.0.0.1 are elevated to the admin level, granting a potential attacker full access to the device.” D-Link’s DCS-2132L cloud camera. A MitM attacker can intercept the network traffic and acquire the data stream of the TCP connection on the server (cloud) port 2048 — from there, he or she can see the HTTP requests for the video and audio packets. An attacker could then capture the streamed video content for playback. “[Streams] can then be reconstructed and replayed by the attacker, at any time, to obtain the current audio or video stream from that camera,” researcher said. Threatpost reached out to D-Link for comment, but as of press time the company had not replied back.   A Second Plugin Bug Allows Rogue Firmware Updates A second vulnerability was identified by ESET that relates to D-Link’s “MyDlink Services” web browser plugin, which allows camera owners a way to view video content without using the app. With this bug, the flaw only manifests when a user is live-streaming content to the plugin. “The web browser plugin manages the creation of the TCP tunnel and the live video playback in the client’s browser, but is also responsible for forwarding requests for the video and audio data streams through a tunnel, which listens on a dynamically generated port on localhost,” the researchers said. During that window of opportunity, a local unauthenticated user can access the camera’s web interface simply by opening the hxxp://127.0.0.1:RANDOM_PORT/ address. “The tunnel is made available for the whole operating system, so any application or user on the client’s computer can simply access the camera’s web interface by a simple request,” they said. This allows an attackers to create a non-trivial attack where they can replace the legitimate firmware with their own rigged or back-doored version, researchers said.   Port 80 Exposure, With No User Consent Additional bugs were identified by ESET, including one in the device’s Universal Plug and Play that opens port 80 on home router, exposing the HTTP interface to potential hackers who are scanning for the open port. A ESET scan of DCS-2132L cameras with port 80 open on April 10 indicated 1,600 vulnerable devices. Over 30 percent of those cameras were located in the United States, according to the Shodan scan. On August 22, ESET disclosed the vulnerabilities to D-Link. Partial Fixes D-Link has addressed some of the issues — however, the fixes aren’t comprehensive. “Since [ESET first reported the bugs], some of the vulnerabilities have been mitigated,” researchers stated. “According to our tests, the ‘MyDlink services’ plug-in is now properly secured – although other issues persist. At the time of writing, the most recent version of firmware available for download was from November 2016 and did not address the vulnerabilities allowing malicious replacement of the camera’s firmware, as well as interception of audio and video streams.” ESET advises owners to ensure port 80 on their router isn’t exposed to the public internet and said that users should “reconsider the use of remote access if the camera is monitoring highly sensitive areas of their household or company.” ESET issued a patch on August 28 for its myDlink plugin.

"A malicious fax sent to an HP Inc. OfficeJet all-in-one inkjet printer can give hackers control of the printer and act as a springboard into an attached network environment. LAS VEGAS – Tens of millions of fax-ready HP OfficeJet inkjet printers are vulnerable to a simple hack that gives an attacker full control over a targeted printer. Once compromised, the all-in-one OfficeJet could act as a springboard for deeper network penetration by an attacker. Here at DEF CON, researchers at Check Point released public details on two critical vulnerabilities found in HP’s implementation of a widely used fax protocol used in all its OfficeJet all-in-one inkjet printers. In coordination with Check Point’s public disclosure, HP Inc. released patches for both vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-5925 and CVE-2018-5924). “We are able to take complete control over the printer just by sending a malicious fax,” said Yaniv Balmas, malware research team lead with Check Point. “There is no prerequisite for this attack. All you need to do is send a malicious fax to the printer and you have control.” Once the fax machine is compromised, Check Point researchers were able to demonstrate how they could leverage the NSA spy-tool EternalBlue for further penetration. In March 2017, Microsoft patched the underlying Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) vulnerability that EternalBlue exploited. While the numbers of fax machines and users has plummeted over the years, hospitals and insurance companies are still dependent on them. To a lesser extent legal, banking and real estate sectors also use fax machines for some transactions – mainly because of signature requirements and fax verification of delivery features. “Nobody owns just a fax machine. Instead they own all-in-one printers,” Balmas said. “Many are connected to vulnerable networks.” He estimates there are 46 million fax machines still in use today, with 17 million of them in the United States. The vulnerability is tied to all-in-one printers that support Group 3 (G3) fax protocols, part of the ITU T.30 standard for sending and receiving color faxes. “This standard defines the basic capabilities required from the sender and the receiver, while also outlining the different phases of the protocol,” according to Check Point that published its research on the hack Sunday. The fax vulnerability is exploited during the receiving handshake. “We could reach this vulnerability by sending a huge XML (> 2GB) to the printer over TCP port 53048 thus triggering a stack-based buffer overflow. Exploiting this vulnerability then gave us full control over the printer, meaning that we could use this as a debugging vulnerability,” researchers wrote. Typically, when sending a fax the OfficeJet printer uses .TIFF image format. The sending fax broadcasts the .TIFF meta-data for the receiving fax machine to use for such things as page sizes. The (ITU T.30 standard) protocol dictates an examination of that meta-data by the receiving fax for data continuity and sanitation. However, when researchers sent a color fax, they noticed the sending/receiving machines used the image format .JPG instead of .TIFF. “When we examined the code that handles the colourful faxes we found out another good finding: the received data is stored to a .jpg file without any check. In contrast to the .tiff case in which the headers are built by the receiver, in the .jpg case we controlled the entire file,” researchers noted. “When the target printer receives a colourful fax it simply dumps its content into a .jpg file (“%s/jfxp_temp%d_%d.jpg” to be precise), without any sanitation checks.” Upon receiving the color fax data the vulnerable OfficeJet printers used a custom JPEG parser to interpret the fax data. “This means that instead of using libjpeg, the developers implemented their own JPEG parser. From an attacker’s point of view this is a jackpot, as finding a vulnerability in a complex file format parser looks very promising,” they wrote. In total researchers found two vulnerabilities with this custom .JPEG parser – both stack-based buffer overflows. Both were rated critical, with a rating of 9.8 – based on NIST’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System. “A maliciously crafted file sent to an affected device can cause a stack or static buffer overflow, which could allow remote code execution,” wrote HP on its support page. : Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] A malicious fax sent to an HP Inc.

"The following statistics were compiled in August using data collected from computers running Kaspersky Lab products:August is traditionally one of the busiest months for the information security industry, despite the summer holiday season. Two of the top security conferences take place in August in the US: BlackHat and Defcon. These two events are a popular platform for announcing the results of top studies and not only discuss the results of the past year, but address the issues looming on the horizon. New attack methods are discussed at the conferences, in addition to different hacking technologies — some of which, unfortunately, are subsequently applied in malicious programs. Furthermore, the summer holiday season creates additional problems for individual computer users and organizations alike. People on vacation use the Internet more frequently at Internet cafes, free WiFi hotspots, airports, etc., which means they are outside of their usual security perimeter and have higher chances of becoming the victims of malicious users.Let’s take a closer look at some of the new malicious programs and malicious technologies employed by “the other side” in August.The ZeuS Trojan (Trojan-Spy.Win32.Zbot) has been the most widespread threat for users of online banking services for several years now. Based on the number of incidents involving ZeuS and the damage it has caused, it could truly be viewed as a kind of malware ‘deity’ among cyber criminals. An entire industry of cybercrime – primarily Russian – has been built around ZeuS. Dozens of groups use it directly and indirectly as part of their illegitimate activities.Last year, information came to light indicating that the creator of ZeuS sold his entire design to another virus writer, the author of the SpyEye Trojan. This meant that instead of two competing projects, we would see one that brought together the best technologies of the two. That is exactly what happened in the new versions of SpyEye, which are now being regularly detected and are the successors of old ZeuS.However, more or less at the same time that this so-called merger took place, part of the ZeuS code was also leaked and subsequently became available to anyone who wanted it. Since the SpyEye’s creator sells his creations on the cybercrime market for several thousands of dollars, clearly anyone who did not want to pay but wanted to create their own clone would now be able to do so using the very same source code.In August, one of these clones became relatively widespread and got the attention of information security professionals. Note that it appeared considerably earlier, in spring 2011, but did not become a common choice among cyber criminals until summer. The new modification has been dubbed Ice IX and is sold for $600-1,800. Just like with the backstories of ZeuS and SpyEye, once again we are dealing with the work of Russian-speaking cyber criminals. One of the most remarkable innovations in Ice IX is the altered web module for botnet control, which allows cyber criminals to use legitimate hosting services, instead of having to resort to costly bulletproof servers within the cybercriminal community. This difference is meant to keep hosting costs down for Ice IX owners.The blatant theft of someone else’s code is typical in the cybercriminal community. The appearance of Ice IX, which not only competes with SpyEye but also considerable reduces the costs for running similar Trojans, will soon lead to the emergence of new “bastard children” of ZeuS and an even greater number of attacks against the users of online banking services.This summer, the Bitcoin e-money system became the center of attention among computer users and criminals alike. The computer-based ‘coin-generation’ system became yet another means of illegitimate earnings, and stands out due to the high level of anonymity. The quantity of coins that are generated depends on your computer’s capabilities. The larger the computers to which you have access, then the larger your potential earnings are. With a relatively quick attack against the owners of bitcoin wallets, cyber criminals were able to not only steal them and go a few steps further and use the victim machines for botnets.Back in June we detected the first Trojan.NSIS.Miner.a, which generated bitcoins on an infected computer without the user noticing. This incident marked the beginning of our collaboration with a number of major bitcoin pools (servers where data about network participants and their accounts are stored), which helped us intercept several similar botnets. The beginning of the standoff between the antivirus industry and criminals in this new field has led to the emergence of many more new, more sophisticated types of bitcoin botnets.In August, cyber criminals found new uses for technologies such as Twitter, P2P networks, and proxy servers.The use of Twitter essentially worked as follows: a bot would send a request to a Twitter account, which provides commands that are left there by the botnet owner — i.e., where the bitcoin-generating program is downloaded, along with instructions for which bitcoin pools to work with. The use of Twitter as a botnet command center is not new, although this is the first time it has been used with the bitcoin system.P2P botnets are not anything radically new per se, but the Trojan.Win32.Miner.h P2P botnet detected by Kaspersky Lab experts in August now has, at the most conservative count, nearly 40,000 different public IP addresses. In light of the fact that most computers are currently behind firewalls or gateways, the actual amount of infected machines could be several times higher. The bot installs a system of three bitcoin miners at once: Ufasoft miner, RCP miner, and Phoenix miner.The two technologies described above make it easier for malicious users to maintain their botnets and use measures to counteract antivirus companies, which can more easily block centralized botnet command centers.The bitcoin pool accounts held by malicious users always face the threat of being deleted by server owners who take a proactive stance against unlawful mining programs. In August, Kaspersky Lab discovered that one of the largest botnets was not only used to mine bitcoins, it was also now beginning to be used as a means of concealing actual accounts. To achieve this, the botnet owners created a special proxy server that interacts with infected computers, and their requests are then transferred to an unknown bitcoin pool. It is not possible to identify the way in which the bot code is analyzed, the specific pools that the botnet works with, and thus block the fraudulent accounts. The only means of intercepting this type of criminal activity in this situation is to gain full access to one of the proxy servers.All in all, at the end of the month, Kaspersky Lab detected 35 unique malicious programs that targeted the bitcoin system in one way or another.The Morto worm is a relatively interesting development; its rapid spread began in the second half of August. Unlike its most noteworthy predecessors, this worm does not exploit vulnerabilities in order to self-replicate. Furthermore, it spreads via the Windows RDP service, a method which has not been seen before. This service is used to provide remote access to a Windows desktop. The worm essentially attempts to find the access password. Based on early projections, at present this worm could have infected several tens of thousands of computers around the world. The primary threat stems from the fact that malicious users have the ability to manage the infected computers, since the worm contains a botnet function and communicates with several command servers. Furthermore, the botnet’s primary function is launching DDoS attacks.Just over one year ago (in early August 2010), the first-ever malicious program for the Android operating system was detected: the SMS Trojan FakePlayer. Since its emergence, the global malware situation — both for mobile threats in general and Android in particular — has changed dramatically. Less than one year ago, the number of malicious programs targeting Android caught up with the number of malicious programs targeting the Symbian platform (the first threat for Symbian appeared in 2004). Today, threats designed for Android represent approximately 24% of the overall number of detected threats targeting mobile platforms. Since the arrival of FakePlayer, we have detected 628 modifications of malicious programs targeting Android.The distribution of malicious programs targeting mobile platforms, by operating systemA total of 85% of all smartphone threats (i.e. excepting J2ME) detected from August 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011 target the Android system.These days, 99% of all detected threats targeting mobile platforms are malicious programs that are after one and the same goal: generating money unlawfully, either directly or indirectly. In August, the standout among these types of threats was the Nickspy Trojan, the distinguishing characteristic of which is the ability to record all of the conversations of the infected device’s owner into audio files and upload these files to a remote server managed by the malicious owner. One of the modifications of this Trojan is disguised as a Google+ add-on and is capable of accepting incoming calls from malicious user numbers written into the program’s configuration file. When an infected phone receives this kind of call without the user noticing, the malicious user is then able to listen in on everything within the infected device’s range, including its owner’s conversations. Additionally, the Trojan also takes note of messages, information about calls, and GPS coordinates. All of these data are sent to the malicious user’s remote server.“Non-commercialized” malicious programs targeting mobile devices are becoming more common, although some of them are rather odd. In August, the Dogwar Trojan was detected. It appears that this program was developed by people (or a person) supporting PETA’s cause of the protection of animal rights. Having taken the beta version of the Dog Wars game, a malicious user replaced the BETA in the program’s icon with PETA, and planted malicious code, which:Internet-based corporate espionage and reconnaissance led by a variety of countries around the world is gradually becoming one of the most widely discussed information security problems, spinning off from traditional cybercrime. However, the newness of the field and its relative inaccessibility to most users means that most news about this kind of activity is needlessly sensationalized.In August, the IT community was shaken by a news item from McAfee (acquired by Intel one year ago) about their detection of what was potentially the largest cyber-attack in history, lasting over five years and targeting numerous organizations around the world, from the US Department of Defense, to the Sports Committee of Vietnam. The attack was dubbed Shady Rat. All would have been well and good if the publication of that information had not coincided with the opening of the BlackHat conference in Las Vegas, and covered by a special feature in Vanity Fair. One can’t help but agree that exclusive material about a threat to national security in a fashion magazine is a bit odd — the security industry does not typically use that route to inform the public about recently detected problems.A close look at what McAfee reported resulted in even more confusion. First of all, the malicious user-run server that was allegedly “detected by researchers” had in fact already been known for several months to the experts at many other antivirus companies. Second, at the time of the article’s publication, the server was still up and running, and all of the information that McAfee used in its report had already been public. Next, the long sought-after spyware that had allegedly been used in the most complex and largest attack in history had already been detected by many antivirus programs using simple heuristics. In addition to these and other factors, the McAfee gives rise to some other questions. These questions were asked publically, including by Kaspersky Lab experts.Our studies have confirmed that Shady Rat was neither the longest-running or the largest, nor even the most sophisticated attack in history. Moreover, we believe that it is unacceptable to publish information about any attacks without a full description of all of the components and technologies used, since these incomplete reports do not allow experts to make all possible efforts to protect their own resources.The publication of information about so-called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) should involve an even greater degree of responsibility. Recently, APTs have been making media outlet headlines featuring terms such as ‘cyberwar’ and ‘cyberweapons.’ There is a major gap in the public perception and actual meaning of these terms. Incidentally, terminology issues are of secondary importance when the issue at hand is truly about corporate espionage or special force operations. In these cases, it is much more important to remember that when too much focus is directed at these incidents, and the disclosure of any kind of information is not carefully coordinated, it could harm ongoing investigations and deal an even greater blow to attack victims.August turned out to be an eventful month in the hacking world. Attacks against companies and government agencies take place around the world and, in contrast to attacks launched by unknown parties, this year many incidents were launched by groups that have gone public, such as AntiSec and Anonymous. More and more frequently, these attacks are employed as a means of political struggle. All of these cases receive wide coverage in the press, since publicity of the event is critical for promoting the ideology of the so-called ‘hacktivists.’ Given the events of this year so far, the hacking scandals that took place in August were not, unfortunately, particularly surprising.Over the reporting period, the victims of hacktivists included the Italian cyber police, a number of companies cooperating with law enforcement agencies in the US, and the military contractor Vanguard, who work with communications systems under contract with the US Department of Defense. Gigabytes of private information were made public, and in the situation involving the Italian cyber police, documents that had likely initially been the property of the Indian Embassy to Russia had been made public.Later, in the US, hackers attacked a transit system in the San Francisco Bay Area and stole the personal data of two thousand passengers, which was subsequently published. The defacement of the official government websites of Syria and Libya, in connection with the civil uprisings in these countries, also stand out among the politically-motivated hack attacks that took place in August.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] The following statistics were compiled in August using data collected from computers running Kaspersky Lab products:August is traditionally one of the busiest months for the information security industry, despite the summer holiday season. Two of the top security conferences take place in August in the US: BlackHat and Defcon. These two events are a popular platform for announcing the results of top studies and not only discuss the results of the past year, but address the issues looming on the horizon. New attack methods are discussed at the conferences, in addition to different hacking technologies — some of which, unfortunately, are subsequently applied in malicious programs. Furthermore, the summer holiday season creates additional problems for individual computer users and organizations alike. People on vacation use the Internet more frequently at Internet cafes, free WiFi hotspots, airports, etc., which means they are outside of their usual security perimeter and have higher chances of becoming the victims of malicious users.Let’s take a closer look at some of the new malicious programs and malicious technologies employed by “the other side” in August.The ZeuS Trojan (Trojan-Spy.Win32.Zbot) has been the most widespread threat for users of online banking services for several years now. Based on the number of incidents involving ZeuS and the damage it has caused, it could truly be viewed as a kind of malware ‘deity’ among cyber criminals. An entire industry of cybercrime – primarily Russian – has been built around ZeuS. Dozens of groups use it directly and indirectly as part of their illegitimate activities.Last year, information came to light indicating that the creator of ZeuS sold his entire design to another virus writer, the author of the SpyEye Trojan. This meant that instead of two competing projects, we would see one that brought together the best technologies of the two. That is exactly what happened in the new versions of SpyEye, which are now being regularly detected and are the successors of old ZeuS.However, more or less at the same time that this so-called merger took place, part of the ZeuS code was also leaked and subsequently became available to anyone who wanted it. Since the SpyEye’s creator sells his creations on the cybercrime market for several thousands of dollars, clearly anyone who did not want to pay but wanted to create their own clone would now be able to do so using the very same source code.In August, one of these clones became relatively widespread and got the attention of information security professionals. Note that it appeared considerably earlier, in spring 2011, but did not become a common choice among cyber criminals until summer. The new modification has been dubbed Ice IX and is sold for $600-1,800. Just like with the backstories of ZeuS and SpyEye, once again we are dealing with the work of Russian-speaking cyber criminals. One of the most remarkable innovations in Ice IX is the altered web module for botnet control, which allows cyber criminals to use legitimate hosting services, instead of having to resort to costly bulletproof servers within the cybercriminal community. This difference is meant to keep hosting costs down for Ice IX owners.The blatant theft of someone else’s code is typical in the cybercriminal community. The appearance of Ice IX, which not only competes with SpyEye but also considerable reduces the costs for running similar Trojans, will soon lead to the emergence of new “bastard children” of ZeuS and an even greater number of attacks against the users of online banking services.This summer, the Bitcoin e-money system became the center of attention among computer users and criminals alike. The computer-based ‘coin-generation’ system became yet another means of illegitimate earnings, and stands out due to the high level of anonymity. The quantity of coins that are generated depends on your computer’s capabilities. The larger the computers to which you have access, then the larger your potential earnings are. With a relatively quick attack against the owners of bitcoin wallets, cyber criminals were able to not only steal them and go a few steps further and use the victim machines for botnets.Back in June we detected the first Trojan.NSIS.Miner.a, which generated bitcoins on an infected computer without the user noticing. This incident marked the beginning of our collaboration with a number of major bitcoin pools (servers where data about network participants and their accounts are stored), which helped us intercept several similar botnets. The beginning of the standoff between the antivirus industry and criminals in this new field has led to the emergence of many more new, more sophisticated types of bitcoin botnets.In August, cyber criminals found new uses for technologies such as Twitter, P2P networks, and proxy servers.The use of Twitter essentially worked as follows: a bot would send a request to a Twitter account, which provides commands that are left there by the botnet owner — i.e., where the bitcoin-generating program is downloaded, along with instructions for which bitcoin pools to work with. The use of Twitter as a botnet command center is not new, although this is the first time it has been used with the bitcoin system.P2P botnets are not anything radically new per se, but the Trojan.Win32.Miner.h P2P botnet detected by Kaspersky Lab experts in August now has, at the most conservative count, nearly 40,000 different public IP addresses. In light of the fact that most computers are currently behind firewalls or gateways, the actual amount of infected machines could be several times higher. The bot installs a system of three bitcoin miners at once: Ufasoft miner, RCP miner, and Phoenix miner.The two technologies described above make it easier for malicious users to maintain their botnets and use measures to counteract antivirus companies, which can more easily block centralized botnet command centers.The bitcoin pool accounts held by malicious users always face the threat of being deleted by server owners who take a proactive stance against unlawful mining programs. In August, Kaspersky Lab discovered that one of the largest botnets was not only used to mine bitcoins, it was also now beginning to be used as a means of concealing actual accounts. To achieve this, the botnet owners created a special proxy server that interacts with infected computers, and their requests are then transferred to an unknown bitcoin pool. It is not possible to identify the way in which the bot code is analyzed, the specific pools that the botnet works with, and thus block the fraudulent accounts. The only means of intercepting this type of criminal activity in this situation is to gain full access to one of the proxy servers.All in all, at the end of the month, Kaspersky Lab detected 35 unique malicious programs that targeted the bitcoin system in one way or another.The Morto worm is a relatively interesting development; its rapid spread began in the second half of August. Unlike its most noteworthy predecessors, this worm does not exploit vulnerabilities in order to self-replicate. Furthermore, it spreads via the Windows RDP service, a method which has not been seen before. This service is used to provide remote access to a Windows desktop. The worm essentially attempts to find the access password. Based on early projections, at present this worm could have infected several tens of thousands of computers around the world. The primary threat stems from the fact that malicious users have the ability to manage the infected computers, since the worm contains a botnet function and communicates with several command servers. Furthermore, the botnet’s primary function is launching DDoS attacks.Just over one year ago (in early August 2010), the first-ever malicious program for the Android operating system was detected: the SMS Trojan FakePlayer. Since its emergence, the global malware situation — both for mobile threats in general and Android in particular — has changed dramatically. Less than one year ago, the number of malicious programs targeting Android caught up with the number of malicious programs targeting the Symbian platform (the first threat for Symbian appeared in 2004). Today, threats designed for Android represent approximately 24% of the overall number of detected threats targeting mobile platforms. Since the arrival of FakePlayer, we have detected 628 modifications of malicious programs targeting Android.The distribution of malicious programs targeting mobile platforms, by operating systemA total of 85% of all smartphone threats (i.e. excepting J2ME) detected from August 1, 2010 through August 31, 2011 target the Android system.These days, 99% of all detected threats targeting mobile platforms are malicious programs that are after one and the same goal: generating money unlawfully, either directly or indirectly. In August, the standout among these types of threats was the Nickspy Trojan, the distinguishing characteristic of which is the ability to record all of the conversations of the infected device’s owner into audio files and upload these files to a remote server managed by the malicious owner. One of the modifications of this Trojan is disguised as a Google+ add-on and is capable of accepting incoming calls from malicious user numbers written into the program’s configuration file. When an infected phone receives this kind of call without the user noticing, the malicious user is then able to listen in on everything within the infected device’s range, including its owner’s conversations. Additionally, the Trojan also takes note of messages, information about calls, and GPS coordinates. All of these data are sent to the malicious user’s remote server.“Non-commercialized” malicious programs targeting mobile devices are becoming more common, although some of them are rather odd. In August, the Dogwar Trojan was detected. It appears that this program was developed by people (or a person) supporting PETA’s cause of the protection of animal rights. Having taken the beta version of the Dog Wars game, a malicious user replaced the BETA in the program’s icon with PETA, and planted malicious code, which:Internet-based corporate espionage and reconnaissance led by a variety of countries around the world is gradually becoming one of the most widely discussed information security problems, spinning off from traditional cybercrime. However, the newness of the field and its relative inaccessibility to most users means that most news about this kind of activity is needlessly sensationalized.In August, the IT community was shaken by a news item from McAfee (acquired by Intel one year ago) about their detection of what was potentially the largest cyber-attack in history, lasting over five years and targeting numerous organizations around the world, from the US Department of Defense, to the Sports Committee of Vietnam. The attack was dubbed Shady Rat. All would have been well and good if the publication of that information had not coincided with the opening of the BlackHat conference in Las Vegas, and covered by a special feature in Vanity Fair. One can’t help but agree that exclusive material about a threat to national security in a fashion magazine is a bit odd — the security industry does not typically use that route to inform the public about recently detected problems.A close look at what McAfee reported resulted in even more confusion. First of all, the malicious user-run server that was allegedly “detected by researchers” had in fact already been known for several months to the experts at many other antivirus companies. Second, at the time of the article’s publication, the server was still up and running, and all of the information that McAfee used in its report had already been public. Next, the long sought-after spyware that had allegedly been used in the most complex and largest attack in history had already been detected by many antivirus programs using simple heuristics.

"Unauthenticated cyberattackers can also wreak havoc on networking device configurations. Cisco is warning three critical security vulnerabilities affect its flagship IOS XE software, the operating system for most of its enterprise networking portfolio. The flaws impact Cisco’s wireless controllers, SD-WAN offering and configuration mechanisms in use for scads of products. The networking giant has released patches for all of them, as part of a comprehensive 32-bug update released this week. The most severe of the critical bugs is an unauthenticated remote-code-execution (RCE) and denial-of-service (DoS) bug, affecting the Cisco Catalyst 9000 family of wireless controllers. CVE-2021-34770: RCE and DoS for Wireless Controllers Boasting a rare 10 out of 10 CVSS vulnerability-severity rating, the issue (CVE-2021-34770) specifically exists in the control and provisioning of wireless access points (CAPWAP) protocol processing used by the Cisco IOS XE software that powers the devices. “The vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs during the validation of CAPWAP packets,” Cisco explained in its advisory this week. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition.” Absent a workaround or mitigation, admins should patch as soon as possible to avoid compromise. The affected products are: Catalyst 9800 Embedded Wireless Controller for Catalyst 9300, 9400, and 9500 Series Switches Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controllers for Cloud Embedded Wireless Controller on Catalyst Access Points RCE and DoS for Cisco SD-WAN The next two critical bugs both rate 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS scale. The first of these is a software-buffer-overflow issue (CVE-2021-34727) in Cisco’s SD-WAN software (which can be enabled via IOS XE software), which could allow unauthenticated RCE as root and DoS attacks. It arises in the vDaemon process, according to the advisory. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds-checking when an affected device processes traffic,” according to Cisco. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow and possibly execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges, or cause the device to reload, which could result in a denial-of-service condition.” Once again there are no workarounds or mitigations for this one, so patching promptly is a good idea. The following products are vulnerable if orgs are using the SD-WAN feature: 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs) 4000 Series ISRs ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Cloud Services Router 1000V Series CVE-2021-1619: Endangering Device Configurations The last critical bug is an authentication-bypass vulnerability in the IOS XE software – specifically affecting the network configuration protocol (NETCONF) used to install, manipulate and delete the configuration of network devices through a network management system; and the RESTCONF protocol, which is a REST-based HTTP interface used to query and configure devices with NETCONF configuration datastores. The issue (CVE-2021-1619) specifically resides in the authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) function, Cisco explained, which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and wreak havoc in a couple of ways: Install, manipulate or delete the configuration of an affected device Cause memory corruption that results in DoS “This vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable,” according to the advisory. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device.” This vulnerability affects devices running the following: Cisco IOS XE software if configured for autonomous or controller mode Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN software Workaround, Mitigation Available Unlike the previous two bugs, this one has both a workaround and a mitigation. On the workaround front, it’s important to note that to be vulnerable, three things must be configured: AAA NETCONF, RESTCONF or both “Enable password” used without “enable secret” Thus, users can remove the “enable password” configuration and configure “enable secret” instead, in order to protect themselves. As for a mitigation, to limit the attack surface, admins can ensure that access control lists (ACLs) are in place for NETCONF and RESTCONF to prevent attempted access from untrusted subnets, Cisco advised.

Upon hearing the tragic news coming out of Ukraine, Comodo wishes to extend sympathy to all those suffering in this dark time. Loss of life and injuries for countless individuals highlight the physical battleground, but war is being waged in the digital realm as well, creating a second front line. For the past few years, our very own Comodo Threat Lab has identified an ever-increasing rate of malware and other sophisticated cyberattacks. This ‘second battlefront line’ is not a new phenomenon and one could argue that this concept of cyber warfare has been a long time coming. Whilst we sit thousands of miles away from the front line in East Europe, the digital war can and will easily spread beyond the physical borders. Earlier this week, President Biden sent a direct warning of sanctions being imposed on the aggressor, in this case being Russia. But this announcement was soon followed by US officials advising private and public sector organizations to stay alert for any repercussion ransomware attacks in response to the heavy US and UK sanctions. What does this mean for your organization? Prior to Russia’s physical invasion on Thursday, Ukraine was already in the process of being bombarded with cyberattacks on all digital fronts, attacking critical infrastructure and Ukrainian private networks with a newly discovered (and catastrophic) data-wiping malware. At Comodo, we cannot emphasize enough the importance that every organization should not continue planning but rather enforce and deploy the appropriate security measures that continually monitor and respond to incoming threats. The mid-market is one such group that forms the backbone of numerous economies yet misses out on affordable enterprise-grade security. This mid-market cluster is equally not immune to targeted attacks, similar to large enterprises. It’s important to highlight whether a company is or is not a direct target of a foreign Government is beside the point. The risk comes directly from those that sympathize with that foreign Government, who in their quest to launch attacks and sabotage at will, can take place against ANY company regardless of size, sector or country. Whether your organization is a 5-person startup or 1000+ corporation, everyone is a target and there’s no escaping that fact. The primary considerations that all organizations must ask themselves is if a nation-state attack hits you tomorrow, what would that mean for your direct business operations and customers? Will you be able to continue functioning? Will you be able to continue paying employee salaries? Can you pay your suppliers? And that’s only touching the surface…there is much more to reflect on. We’re not here to tell you what solution(s) you should be investing in, after all, you know your IT environment better than anyone else and already understand that a single ‘silver bullet’ solution may not exist.

This ‘second battlefront line’ is not a new phenomenon and one could argue that this concept of cyber warfare has been a long time coming. Whilst we sit thousands of miles away from the front line in East Europe, the digital war can and will easily spread beyond the physical borders. Earlier this week, President Biden sent a direct warning of sanctions being imposed on the aggressor, in this case being Russia. But this announcement was soon followed by US officials advising private and public sector organizations to stay alert for any repercussion ransomware attacks in response to the heavy US and UK sanctions. What does this mean for your organization? Prior to Russia’s physical invasion on Thursday, Ukraine was already in the process of being bombarded with cyberattacks on all digital fronts, attacking critical infrastructure and Ukrainian private networks with a newly discovered (and catastrophic) data-wiping malware. At Comodo, we cannot emphasize enough the importance that every organization should not continue planning but rather enforce and deploy the appropriate security measures that continually monitor and respond to incoming threats. The mid-market is one such group that forms the backbone of numerous economies yet misses out on affordable enterprise-grade security. This mid-market cluster is equally not immune to targeted attacks, similar to large enterprises. It’s important to highlight whether a company is or is not a direct target of a foreign Government is beside the point. The risk comes directly from those that sympathize with that foreign Government, who in their quest to launch attacks and sabotage at will, can take place against ANY company regardless of size, sector or country. Whether your organization is a 5-person startup or 1000+ corporation, everyone is a target and there’s no escaping that fact. The primary considerations that all organizations must ask themselves is if a nation-state attack hits you tomorrow, what would that mean for your direct business operations and customers? Will you be able to continue functioning? Will you be able to continue paying employee salaries? Can you pay your suppliers? And that’s only touching the surface…there is much more to reflect on. We’re not here to tell you what solution(s) you should be investing in, after all, you know your IT environment better than anyone else and already understand that a single ‘silver bullet’ solution may not exist. However, we can advise on the measures your organization can take for a proactive and preventative approach to securing your digital borders.

"U.S. intelligence said that the Chaos iPhone remote takeover exploit was used against the minority ethnic group before Apple could patch the problem. In 2019, a Chinese security researcher working with the internet security and antivirus company Qihoo 360 unveiled an intricately woven exploit: One that would allegedly let a remote attacker easily jailbreak an iPhone X iOS 12.1.  The researcher, Qixun Zhao, dubbed the exploit Chaos, for good reason. As this proof-of-concept video allegedly shows, a successful exploit would allow a remote attacker to jailbreak an iPhoneX, with the targeted user none the wiser, allowing the intruder to gain access to a victim\u2019s data, processing power and more. It worked as a drive-by malware download, only requiring that the iPhone user visit a web page containing Qixun\u2019s malicious code.  It would have made a superb spying tool, seeing how it would let an attacker easily take control of even the newest, most up-to-date iPhones, enabling a snooper to read a victim\u2019s messages and passwords and to track their location in near-real time.

According to a report published by MIT Technology Review on Thursday, that\u2019s exactly what happened: \u201cVirtually overnight,\u201d Chinese intelligence allegedly used the exploit as a weapon before Apple could fix the problem.  The publication said that, according to its sources, the U.S. has amassed details of how the Chaos exploit was used to hack China\u2019s Uyghur Muslims \u2014 a common target of espionage campaigns. The claim is bolstered by earlier reporting: In August 2019, sources told TechCrunch that malicious websites used to hack into iPhones over two years were targeting the Uyghurs.  Look-Alike Exploits Google security researchers had found and disclosed the malicious websites a week before TechCrunch\u2019s report, but they hadn\u2019t initially known who the malicious sites were targeting. However, they knew that the code looked familiar: In an in-depth examination, Google noted how similar the malicious-sites exploit was to Chaos.  Now, MIT Technology Review has learned that the U.S. had come to the same conclusion, and that it had \u201cquietly\u201d informed Apple. Apple, which had been tracking the attack, had already come to the same conclusion on its own: That the Chaos exploit and the attacks on Uyghurs were \u201cone and the same,\u201d as the outlet puts it.   Prioritizing a difficult fix, Apple issued an update to patch the flaw in January 2019.  The patch arrived two months after Chaos had been unveiled at the inaugural Tianfu Cup: A Chinese hacking contest that came into being a few months after the country banned its cybersecurity research teams from competing in the Pwn2Own hacking competition\u2026or, for that matter, in any global hacking or capture-the-flag competitions.  Keeping Security Know-How at Home? The ban on researchers attending foreign competitions apparently grew out of a distaste for giving away vulnerabilities \u2013 via disclosure in public to conference audiences or to hacking programs in real-time. Both the ban and the subsequent launch of the Tianfu Cup had followed close on the heels of an announcement from Qixun\u2019s boss \u2013 Zhou Hongyi, the billionaire founder and CEO of Qihoo 360 \u2013 criticizing the export of vulnerabilities that, once made public, can \u201cno longer be used.\u201d Both the researchers and their know-how should \u201cstay in China,\u201d he said, in order to maximize the \u201cstrategic value\u201d of zero days.  In an interview with the Chinese news site Sina, the influential CEO called the achievement of winning cash prizes at foreign competitions \u201cimaginary.\u201d Qixun Zhao has emphatically denied involvement, telling MIT Technology Review that he couldn\u2019t remember who came into possession of the exploit code following his win \u2013 for which he was awarded $200,000 \u2013 at Tianfu Cup. Although he\u2019s suggested that the exploit used against Uyghurs was probably used \u201cafter the patch release,\u201d both Google and Apple have documented how it was used before the January 2019 fix. His exploit shares code from other exploit writers, he said, but Apple and U.S. intelligence sources told MIT Technology Review that the exploits aren\u2019t similar; in fact, they\u2019re the same. Qixun may well not be personally involved, given that Chinese law requires citizens and organizations to cooperate with intelligence agencies when asked. Threatpost reached out to Qixun, Qihoo and Apple for comments and will update the article accordingly.

"Some Microsoft applications are vulnerable to an authentication issue that could enable Azure account takeover. A vulnerability in the way Microsoft applications use OAuth for third-party authentication could allow an attacker to take over Azure cloud accounts. OAuth is a protocol that allows app users to share data about their accounts with third-party websites or apps, so that when they sign into the apps they don’t need to re-enter their passwords every time. The vulnerability exists because when Microsoft applications undergo the OAuth 2.0 (the next generation of OAuth) authorization flow, they trust certain third-party domains and sub-domains that are not registered by Microsoft. CyberArk researchers discovered three vulnerable Microsoft applications that trust these unregistered domains: Portfolios (a portfolio management tool), O365 Secure Score (a security analytics tool) and Microsoft Trust Service (a portal providing resources about Microsoft security, privacy and compliance practices). “This vulnerability’s attack surface is very wide and its impact can be very powerful,” said Omer Tsarfati, researcher with CyberArk, in a Monday analysis of the flaw. “By doing nothing more than clicking or visiting a website, the victim can experience the theft of sensitive data, compromised production servers, lost data, manipulation of data, encryption of all the organization’s data with ransomware and more.” OAuth Authentication During a typical OAuth authorization flow, a user from a website or a mobile app can request access from third-party apps in order to log in. In Microsoft’s case, this user would be a Microsoft application user, and the third-party would be a whitelisted URL approved by Microsoft. The owner of the third-party website or application then gets a token with specific permissions to take actions on behalf of the user to whom the token belongs. “To put this in perspective, highly privileged OAuth2 tokens, in most cases, equate to having the username and password for the account itself,” researchers said. The problem is, some of Microsoft’s white-listed URLs are not previously registered in the Azure portal. Looking at the web API URLs that are “trusted” by Microsoft native apps, Tsarfati noticed that some URLs end with with “.cloudapp.net,” “.azurewebsites.net” and .{vm_region}.cloudapp.azure.com.” And, Tsarfati noticed that at least 54 sub-domains with these URL endings were not registered in the Azure portal – plus, there may be more that weren’t discovered, he said. Attackers can take advantage of this by taking over these domains and then registering them, meaning that they would be approved by default and could request users’  “access_tokens,” which would then allow them to take actions using users’ permissions. If a victim is an Azure admin, for instance, an attacker could access high-level permissions, like adding unwanted members to a Microsoft Active Directory role, resetting other users’ passwords or adding users to groups, Tsarfati told Threatpost. The Attack In a proof of concept (PoC) of the attack, researchers showed that an attacker could create a crafted link for the Microsoft OAuth authentication process. This link would need three parameters: The application_id parameter must match the vulnerable OAuth application, the redirect_uri parameter must be white-listed domains, and the resource parameter must be the desired resource that an attacker wants to get access to on behalf of the user. Then, the attacker could embed an iframe tag into a website with the “src” attribute set to the crafted link. Once the victim browses the website (lured in via simple social engineering tactics), the victim’s browser renders the iframe and microsoftonline[.]com redirects the victim to the attacker’s domain and automatically grants the access token. The Javascript running in the domain then sends API requests with the stolen access token. The vulnerability was discovered Oct. 29 and fixed Nov. 19. Researchers publicly disclosed the flaw on Monday. While a patch exists, researchers said that users can also mitigate OAuth risks overall by making sure that all trusted redirect URIs configured in the app are under their ownership, as well as removing unnecessary redirect URIs and disabling non-used applications. “While OAuth 2.0 is an excellent solution for authorization, if misused or misconfigured it could have a tremendous impact, allowing for over-privileged third-party applications or the eventual account takeover by malicious attackers,” said researchers. Tsarfati told Threatpost that Microsoft didn’t issue a CVE because the bug is located only in their Online Service. “We resolved the issue with the applications mentioned in this report in November and customers remain protected,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes Cybercriminals’ big hunt for users’ credentials is gaining momentum rapidly. Their strategy usually stays the same: get attention of the victim, use social engineering techniques to make her run a malicious file, and then steal logins and passwords. But the tactic and the malware hackers use constantly changes. Let’s consider in detail the freshest example of such attack with a new variant of a password stealer recently intercepted by Comodo antimalware tools. The disguise The perpetrators send this phishing email to 184 users: As you can see, it contents a few social engineering tricks to manipulate the victims. Let’s have a closer look at them. First, it’s the subject of the message. A rare human being would miss an information relating to her money. Thus, the perpetrators gain the victims’ attention. They can be sure that most receivers will read the message. Next, the cybercriminals named the file “PAYMENT- PDF” for adding more credibility (in fact, it’s a .ZIP archive, but many non-techy people might not notice that). Then, to imitate authenticity, they add the photo of the “bank telex copy”. A picture is worth a thousand word, so it also raises the chances a victim will open the file. Now let’s see what is hidden inside the “PAYMENT- PDF” in reality? The malware As Comodo analysts revealed, “PAYMENT- PDF” is an .html file containing an obfuscated VBScript. If the user runs it, the script downloads and executes a Portable Executable file from hdoc.duckdns.org:1133/PAYMENT.exe And the malware becomes act covertly on the infected machine. First, it ferrets out information about the applications installed on the PC. It chooses the browsers as the first target and tries to extract logins, passwords, and other private data from them. Notably, the malware attacks a big bunch of various browsers: Mozilla Firefox, IceDragon, Safari, K-Meleon, SeaMonkey, Flock, BlackHawk, Chrome, Nichrome, RockMeIt, Spark, Chromium, Titan Browser, Torch, Yandex, Epic, Vivaldi, Chromodo, Superbird, Coowon, Mustang, 360Browser, Citrio, Orbitum, Iridium, Opera, QupZilla and more. After that, it reads each application’s data files to find all FTP and SSH accounts saved in the system. To be precise, it targets applications MyFTP, FTPBox, sherrodFTP, FTP Now, Xftp, EasyFTP, SftpNetDrive, AbleFTP, JaSFtp, FTPInfo, LinasFTP, Filezilla, Staff-FTP, ALFTP, WinSCP, FTPGetter, SmartFTP and some more. Finally, the malware searches for various email clients — FoxMail, Thunderbird, PocoMail, IncrediMail, Outlook, etc. – to extract the accounts information from them. After collecting all the data, the password stealer sends it to the cybercriminals’ server hta.duckdns.org/excel/fre.php. And that’s the sad final. Now all the victim’s credentials are in the hands of the attackers, and she doesn’t have even a guess about it. Unfortunately, when she’ll have realized what’s happened it could be already too late to take rescue actions… The heat map and details of the attack As you can see, the cybercriminals conducted the attack from Italy-based IP 80.211.7.236 using email “hnym.hnyemei@gmail.com”. The attack started on April 18, 2018 at 14:28 UTC and ended on April 20, 2018 at 07:23 UTC. “In the Comodo Q1 2018 report we pointed out the surge in password stealers, and the case confirms this trend continues growing. This kind of malware is not too sophisticated in its design, but very dangerous in its consequences” comments Fatih Orhan, the Head of Comodo Threat Research Labs. ”Its sneaky behavior let the attackers provide their malevolent activity covertly, so the victims often stay unaware of being hacked until the perpetrators use the stolen credentials. It’s better to care about the protection in advance to prevent your network or PC from the malware break-in than sorry for not doing it later. The one, who prepares better, wins the battle.

The attack started on April 18, 2018 at 14:28 UTC and ended on April 20, 2018 at 07:23 UTC. “In the Comodo Q1 2018 report we pointed out the surge in password stealers, and the case confirms this trend continues growing. This kind of malware is not too sophisticated in its design, but very dangerous in its consequences” comments Fatih Orhan, the Head of Comodo Threat Research Labs. ”Its sneaky behavior let the attackers provide their malevolent activity covertly, so the victims often stay unaware of being hacked until the perpetrators use the stolen credentials. It’s better to care about the protection in advance to prevent your network or PC from the malware break-in than sorry for not doing it later. The one, who prepares better, wins the battle. That’s just the case. Comodo technologies protected our clients from the attack and made the cybercriminals go away with empty pockets”. Live secure with Comodo!

"The website for JavaScript library jQuery is under attack for the second time in a week. Update A day after a compromise of the jQuery website was disclosed, the open source JavaScript library is dealing with a second attack. JQuery Foundation board member Ralph Whitbeck confirmed via email to Threatpost that a new compromise was under way and the organization was taking steps to mitigate. “This one does not involve malware,” Whitbeck said. “We are working hard to lock the site down currently.” The website’s homepage was replaced with a text message: “Common, guys! All your base are belong to us. Just please reinstall dat backdoored spenssh deamon. And all will be fine.” Requests to Whitbeck for further information were not returned prior to publication.Whitbeck later posted a notice to the jQuery site that while the two attacks may not be related, they may have used the same attack vector. “We took the site down as soon as we realized there was a compromise and cleaned the infected files. We are taking steps to re-secure our servers, upgrade dependencies, and address vulnerabilities,” Whitbeck said. “At no point today have there been reports of malware being distributed from any of our sites, nor has the code of any jQuery libraries on our website or CDN been affected or modified today or during last week’s reported attack.” Yesterday, a blog post from security firm RiskIQ warned website administrators that it had detected a compromise of jQuery[.]com on Sept. 18 and said the site was redirecting visitors via a hidden iframe to websites hosting the RIG exploit kit. From there, machines were being infected with data-stealing malware. Last night, Whitbeck said the jQuery team had not yet been able to confirm that breach. “Our internal investigation into our servers and logs have not yet found the RIG exploit kit or evidence that there was in fact a compromise,” Whitbeck said. Whitbeck confirmed the jQuery team was notified by RiskIQ on the 18th, but they’ve been unable to reproduce or confirm a server compromise. “We have not been notified by any other security firm or users of jquery.com confirming a compromise,” Whitbeck said. “Normally, when we have issues with jQuery infrastructure, we hear reports within minutes on Twitter, via IRC, etc.” RiskIQ said none of the jQuery libraries were compromised, indicating that perhaps only the webserver running the jQuery site was infiltrated. JQuery is a free and open source JavaScript library used for a number of things, including building AJAX applications and other dynamic content. According to SimilarTech.com, jQuery is found in 61 percent of the top 10,000 websites, and more than 65 million sites overall. In its report yesterday, RiskIQ said the jquery-cdn[.]com site was still live and redirecting visitors to the RIG page. “Some of this confusion stems from last week’s attackers having set up a domain name intended to dupe users into thinking it was the official jQuery CDN,” Whitbeck said. “Please note that the official domain for jQuery files hosted from our official CDN is code.jquery[.]com.” RIG was discovered earlier this year and typical of other exploit kits, it targets vulnerabilities in popular applications such as Java, Adobe Flash and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Silverlight programs. “It’s important to note that we did not observe any changes within the jQuery library itself, which was likely unaffected by this compromise. However, discovering information-stealing malware on jQuery.com is particularly disconcerting because of the demographic of jQuery users,” RiskIQ director of research James Pleger said. “JQuery users are generally IT systems administrators and web developers, including a large contingent who work within enterprises.” By dropping keyloggers and other malware that scoops up credentials, RiskIQ hypothesizes that the attackers are after privileged users inside the enterprise. “Planting malware capable of stealing credentials on devices owned by privilege accounts holders inside companies could allow attackers to silently compromise enterprise systems, similar to what happened in the infamous Target breach,” Pleger said.

"So much for Windows 10’s security: A zero-day in the device installer software grants admin rights just by plugging in a mouse or other compatible device. UPDATE: Microsoft is investigating. A zero-day bug in the device installer software for Razer peripherals – be they a Razer mouse, keyboard or any device that uses the Synapse utility – gives the plugger-inner full admin rights on Windows 10, just by inserting a compatible peripheral and downloading Synapse. There’s apparently nothing keeping the vulnerability from allowing the same privilege escalation on Windows 11, although, if that operating system has in fact been tested, its vulnerability hasn’t yet been reported. Razer manufactures popular, high-end hardware for gamers, including mouses, keyboards and gaming chairs. Its Razer Synapse software enables users to configure hardware devices, set up macros or map buttons. The bug was reported by security researcher jonhat (@j0nh4t), who tweeted about it on Saturday after initially not hearing back from Razer. As of Sunday, the tweet had caught Razer’s attention, and the manufacturer told jonhat that its security team was working on getting out a fix ASAP. It also awarded jonhat a bug bounty, in spite of the fact that the bug was disclosed. As the researcher tells it and has BleepingComputer confirmed in its own tests, the problem is that when a user plugs in a Razer device (or dongle, if it’s a wireless peripheral), Windows automatically fetches an installer containing driver software and the Synapse utility. The plug-and-play Razer Synapse installation then allows users to gain SYSTEM privileges on the Windows device lickety-split, since, as part of the setup routine, it opens an Explorer window that prompts the user to specify where the driver should be installed. SYSTEM privileges are the highest user privilege level in Windows: With a SYSTEM account, someone can get full control over the system, meaning that they can view, change or delete data; can create new accounts with full user rights; and can install whatever they want – including malware. In other words, the setup routine for Synapse runs with the highest available privileges in Windows 10. Since the RazerInstaller.exe executable was launched via a Windows process running with SYSTEM privileges, the Razer installation program inherited those same Admin privileges. jonhat found that if a user opts to change the default location of the installation folder, it triggers a “Choose a folder” dialog. At that point, you can right-click the installation window and press the Shift key, which opens a PowerShell terminal with those same elevated privileges. Proof-of-Concept Video When j0nh4t initially didn’t hear back from Razer, the researcher posted a video that shows how the bug works. Below is a version of the video that’s clearer than the one initially shared on Twitter: BleepingComputer had a Razer mouse kicking around, so the outlet tested out the vulnerability and quickly confirmed the zero day, managing to gain SYSTEM privileges in Windows 10 within about 2 minutes of plugging it in. Here, There & Everywhere? Granted, anybody who wants to exploit this local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability needs two things: a Razer device and the ability to get at a targeted computer. But, as BleepingComputer pointed out, it can be as easy as spending ~$24 on a Razer mouse and plugging it into Windows 10 to become an admin. RazerInstaller.exe running with SYSTEM privileges. Source: BleepingComputer. It doesn’t necessarily stop here, however. Will Dormann (@wdormann), a vulnerability analyst with the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), suggested that this vulnerability could in fact be universal. Many vulnerabilities fall into the class of “How has nobody realized this before now?” If you combine the facts of “connecting USB automatically loads software” and “software installation happens with privileges”, I’ll wager that there are other exploitable packages out there… —Will Dormann The privilege escalation might be possible in all sorts of peripherals due to the lack of safeguards in Windows that might prevent it. 082321 13:33 UPDATE: Threatpost asked Microsoft for feedback on further safety issues that could arise when it comes to connecting a USB that automatically triggers automatic software loading and when the installation comes with SYSTEM privileges. Microsoft said that it’s aware of recent reports and is investigating the issue. “While this issue requires physical access to a targeted device, we will take any necessary steps to help protect customers,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost on Monday afternoon. The vulnerability isn’t necessarily confined to just Razer peripherals. Another commenter, @Lechatquirit, claimed that the attack also works “with any asus ROG mouse. It will prompt to install armory [sic] crate and execute it as Sys,” the user tweeted in response to jonhat. Armoury Crate is a software portal that displays real-time performance and settings information for connected devices and which works with ROG, TUF Gaming and ASUS products. Razer Calls It a ‘Very Specific’ Attack Vector A Razer spokesperson told Threatpost on Monday that a fix should be out soon for what it called this “very specific use case.” Here’s the full statement: We were made aware of a situation in which our software, in a very specific use case, provides a user with broader access to their machine during the installation process. We have investigated the issue, are currently making changes to the installation application to limit this use case, and will release an updated version shortly.

"The critical and important-severity flaws were found by a team at the China-based Tiunfu Cup hacking challenge. VMware has hurried out fixes for a critical flaw in its ESXi hypervisor, a few weeks after it was found during China’s Tianfu Cup hacking competition. The use-after-free vulnerability (CVE-2020-4004) has a CVSS score of 9.3 out of 10, making it critical. It exists in the eXtensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) USB controller of ESXi. XHCI is an interface specification that defines a register-level description of a host controller for USB. According to VMware in a Thursday advisory, “a malicious actor with local administrative privileges on a virtual machine may exploit this issue.” The attacker would then be able to execute code as the virtual machine’s Virtual Machine Executable (VMX) process running on the host, said VMware’s advisory. The VMX process runs in the VMkernel and is responsible for handling I/O to devices that are not critical to performance. Xiao Wei and Tianwen Tang (VictorV) of the Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team were credited with discovering the flaw, which they found at the 2020 Tianfu Cup Pwn Contest. While further details of the bug – and the exploit – were not disclosed, according to the Tianfu Cup’s Twitter account, the team “got the root of the host OS with one shot.” The Tianfu Cup is a popular ethical hacking contest that took place earlier in November. ESXi versions 6.5, 6.7 and 7.0 are affected by this critical vulnerability; users can update to versions ESXi650-202011301-SG (for version 6.5), ESXi670-202011101-SG (for version 6.7) and ESXi70U1b-17168206 (for version 7.0). A workaround is to remove the xHCI (USB 3.x) controller. In addition, versions of VMware Fusion (versions 11.x), Workstation (15.x) and VMware cloud foundation (ESXi, versions 3.x and 4.x) are also affected. Patches for the VMware cloud foundation are still pending, according to the advisory. VMware also issued patches for an important-severity elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in ESXi, also found by the Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team during the Tiunfu Cup. That flaw (CVE-2020-4005), which scores 8.8 out of 10, exists in the way certain system calls are being managed. According to VMware, a bad actor could leverage the flaw to escalate their privileges on the affected system. However, this bug is more difficult to exploit. For one, with an attacker would need privileges within the VMX process; for another, successful exploitation of this issue is only possible when chained with another vulnerability (such as the use-after-free flaw). Versions 6.5, 6.7 and 7.0 of ESXi are affected by the bugs; as is VMware Cloud Foundation (ESXi, versions 3.x and 4.x). A patch is pending for the latter. These are only the latest flaws to plague the ESXi hypervisor. In October, VMware issued an updated fix for a critical-severity remote code-execution flaw in ESXi. VMware said updated patch versions were available after it was discovered the previous patch, released Oct. 20, did not completely address the vulnerability.

"Out of 92 security vulnerabilities, 66 are rated critical in severity, mostly allowing code execution. The most severe can lead to information disclosure. Adobe has dropped a mammoth out-of-band security update this week, addressing 92 vulnerabilities across 14 products. The majority of the disclosed bugs are critical-severity problems, and most allow arbitrary code execution (ACE). Privilege escalation, denial-of-service and memory leaks/information disclosure are all well-represented, as well. Adobe After Effects, Animate, Audition, Bridge, Character Animator, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom Classic, Media Encoder, Photoshop, Prelude, Premiere Pro, Premiere Elements and the XMP Toolkit SDK all received patches. There’s plenty of commonality across the advisories. For instance, the lion’s share of the bugs allow access to a memory location after the end of a buffer, leading to ACE (a type of memory issue that can be exploited, like a standard buffer overflow in the worst-case scenario). Also, almost all of the critical problems rate 7.8 on the CVSS vulnerability severity scale, except for one type.

For these, the vulnerability results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker can leverage these bugs to execute code in the context of the current process.” The fixes come two weeks after Adobe released its normal monthly Patch Tuesday patches. A company spokesperson characterized the release as “planned” rather than an emergency response – and indeed, Adobe said in its advisories that there’s no evidence that any of the bugs are being exploited in the wild. “While we strive to release regularly scheduled updates on Patch Tuesday, occasionally these regularly scheduled security updates are released on non-Patch Tuesday dates,” a company spokesperson told the Register. Of note: The advisory for Bridge is listed as priority 2 for patching, which in Adobe parlance means that the product has historically been at elevated risk for exploitation, so it comes with a recommendation that administrators patch within 30 days. The other advisories are priority 3, which is the lowest risk level, meaning that administrators can patch “at their discretion.”","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] Out of 92 security vulnerabilities, 66 are rated critical in severity, mostly allowing code execution. The most severe can lead to information disclosure. Adobe has dropped a mammoth out-of-band security update this week, addressing 92 vulnerabilities across 14 products. The majority of the disclosed bugs are critical-severity problems, and most allow arbitrary code execution (ACE). Privilege escalation, denial-of-service and memory leaks/information disclosure are all well-represented, as well. Adobe After Effects, Animate, Audition, Bridge, Character Animator, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom Classic, Media Encoder, Photoshop, Prelude, Premiere Pro, Premiere Elements and the XMP Toolkit SDK all received patches. There’s plenty of commonality across the advisories. For instance, the lion’s share of the bugs allow access to a memory location after the end of a buffer, leading to ACE (a type of memory issue that can be exploited, like a standard buffer overflow in the worst-case scenario). Also, almost all of the critical problems rate 7.8 on the CVSS vulnerability severity scale, except for one type. The advisory lists “NULL pointer dereference bugs causing memory leak” flaws as the most severe issues in the bunch, all rating 8.3 on the CVSS scale.

"An advisory from Akamai warns of a recent reflection style DDoS attack in which the deprecated RIPv1 routing protocol was leveraged against targets. A long-deprecated—and aptly named—routing protocol, RIPv1, still has some life to it. Hackers, since the middle of May, have been carrying out reflection- and amplification-style distributed denial of service attacks using home office and small business routers still running on the old protocol. RIPv1, short for Routing Information Protocol, helps small networks share network route information. It’s been around since 1988, but has been deprecated since 1996. Researchers at Akamai’s Prolexic Security Engineering and Research Team (PLXsert) today put out an advisory about an attack spotted May 16 that peaked at 12.9 Gbps. Akamai said that of the 53,693 devices that responded to RIPv1 queries in a scan it conducted, only 500 unique sources were identified in the DDoS attack. None of them use authentication, making them easy pickings. “Since a majority of these sources sent packets predominantly of the 504-byte size, it’s pretty clear as to why they were leveraged for attack purposes. As attackers discover more sourc­es, it is possible that this vector has the potential to create much larger attacks than what we’ve observed thus far,” the advisory cautions, pointing out that the unused devices could be put to work in larger and more distributed attacks. “Right now, most of the 53,693 possible sources respond with one unique route — making them regu­lar DDoS reflection sources without additional amplification,” Akamai said. Reflection attacks happen when an attacker forges its victim’s IP addresses in order to establish the victim’s systems as the source of requests sent to a massive number of machines. The recipients of those requests then issue an overwhelming flood of responses back to the victim’s network, ultimately crashing that network. These types of DDoS attacks differ from amplification attacks where publicly accessible open DNS servers are used to flood victims with DNS responses. Akamai identified Netopia 2000 and 3000 series routers as the biggest culprits still running the vulnerable and ancient RIPv1 protocol on devices. Close to 19,000 Netopia routers responded in scans conducted by Akamai, which also noted that more than 5,000 ZET ZXv10 and TP-Link TD-8000 series routers collectively responded as well. Most of the Netopia routers, Akamai said, are issued by AT&T to customers in the U.S. BellSouth and MegaPath also distribute the routers, but to a much lesser extent. Source countries, however, that were responsible for the May 16 attack were largely in the Russian Federation, China, Germany, Italy and Spain, each with a large number of routes returned to each RIPv1 query, Akamai said. “The sources confirmed to be used in recent attack cam­paigns were mostly based out of Europe,” the advisory says. “This leaves a lot of potentially untapped resourc­es that could fall victim to abuse in amplification and reflection attacks.” Akamai recommends that reflector sources switch to RIPv2 or a later version and turn on authentication, otherwise assess whether to expose RIP on the WAN interface. It also suggests restricting RIP access through an access control list and allowing only known routers. “The list of available reflection vectors is by no means small, and some vectors have proven more difficult to keep under control than others due to their perva­sive nature (i.e. DNS, SSDP),” the advisory says. “That being said, there is little reason for RIPv1 to continue as an available resource for DDoS attacks. Most of these sources appear to be from out­dated hardware that has been running in home or small-office networks for years.” : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security",T0814 Denial of Service,"<s>[INST] An advisory from Akamai warns of a recent reflection style DDoS attack in which the deprecated RIPv1 routing protocol was leveraged against targets.

"Cisco also disclosed high-severity vulnerabilities in its Webex and SD-WAN products. Cisco has disclosed a zero-day vulnerability – for which there is not yet a patch – in the Windows, macOS and Linux versions of its AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software. While Cisco said it is not aware of any exploits in the wild for the vulnerability, it said Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit code has been released, opening up risks of cybercriminals potentially leveraging the flaw. The flaw (CVE-2020-3556) is an arbitrary code execution vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.3 out of 10, making it high severity. “Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability,” according to Cisco’s Wednesday advisory. “Cisco plans to fix this vulnerability in a future release of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software.” AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, a modular endpoint software product, provides a wide range of security services (such as remote access, web security features, and roaming protection) for endpoints. The flaw could allow an attacker to cause a targeted AnyConnect user to execute a malicious script – however, in order to launch an attack a cybercriminal would need to be authenticated and on the local network. “In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, there must be an ongoing AnyConnect session by the targeted user at the time of the attack,” according to Cisco. “To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would also need valid user credentials on the system upon which the AnyConnect client is being run.” According to Cisco, the vulnerability exists in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel. IPC is a set of programming interfaces that allows a program to handle many user requests at the same time. Specifically in this case, the IPC listener has a lack of authentication. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect client IPC listener,” according to Cisco. “A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would execute with the privileges of the targeted AnyConnect user.” While there are no workarounds that address this vulnerability, one mitigation is to disable the Auto Update and Enable Scripting features. That’s because a vulnerable configuration requires both the Auto Update setting and Enable Scripting setting to be enabled. Auto Update is enabled by default, and Enable Scripting is disabled by default, said Cisco. Gerbert Roitburd from Secure Mobile Networking Lab (TU Darmstadt) was credited with reporting the vulnerability. Cisco on Wednesday issued updates for 13 other high-severity CVEs across multiple products. That includes an arbitrary code execution flaw (CVE-2020-3588) in Cisco’s Webex Meetings Desktop collaboration app, as well as three arbitrary code execution glitches (CVE-2020-3573, CVE-2020-3603, CVE-2020-3604) in its Webex Network Recording Player and Webex Player.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes Spamming refers to use of an electronic messaging system to send unsolicited messages especially advertising messages to a group of recipients. Unsolicited messages mean the recipient did not grant permission for those message to be sent. Anti-spam refers to the use of any software, hardware or process to block spam from entering a system. The anti-spam software uses a set of protocols to determine unsolicited and unwanted messages and prevent those messages from getting to a user’s inbox. Most of the Anti-spam solutions that are available today can be customized as per your needs, allowing only the approved emails into your inbox. Such software always presumes that all the incoming emails are spam, and only allow those, from the people you know, to come in. Benefits of Using Antispam Software Blocking Spam Quarantining Spam Automatic Filter Updates Monitoring Multiple Accounts Your Personal Whitelist Reporting Spam Let us look at some of the benefits and features of the anti-spam software: Blocking Spam Certain anti-spam solutions not only block specific email addresses but also search for subject lines and text in the email messages. You can customize it to block incoming emails based on senders, and even if your email address is not in the recipient field. Quarantining Spam Antispam filters automatically quarantine the spam emails, ensuring your inbox is spam free. Such quarantined emails are held for a fixed number of days, say 30 days or so, and then dumped. During that period, you can check and recover any legitimate email that may have been quarantined. Automatic Filter Updates Most of the anti-virus software comes with automatic filter update feature for timely detection of new types of Malware threats. Automatic updates not only helps the anti-spam software to stay up-to-date, it also helps secure your system from new kinds of Malware. Monitoring Multiple Accounts With this feature, you can monitor and filter spam from multiple accounts. You can filter your home email from work email, and vice versa. Your Personal Whitelist Some anti-spam software allows you to maintain a ‘friendly’ list of people whose emails you wish to accept. These emails will never be mistaken for spam as against the blacklist of spammers. You can also update the list in the future. Reporting Spam Some anti-spam programs allow you to report spam back to the company supplying the program. It helps that company to develop new type of filters based on the analysis of the reported spam. Emails have become a very popular way of advertising, and it is time that you start filtering your emails, to avoid spam. Most of the anti-spam solutions are signature based that use their signature file (blacklist) to detect and respond to new type of Malware. In signature based anti-spam software, new and unknown types of Malware goes undetected since there is a time gap between the time these new type of Malware threats are released and the time anti-spam software vendors have identified them and updated their signature file. This is where Containment technology comes into play. Containment technology works by keeping the threats or harmful files under control or within certain limits. The harmful files are processed in a restricted operating system environment, thus controlling the resources and the spread of infection. Comodo Dome Antispam is the only enterprise anti-spam solution that has containment technology built-in. It uses advanced spam filters, and content analysis engines to identify and prevent unsolicited emails from entering your network.

"How this class of vulnerabilities will impact millions connected devices and potentially wreck the day of IT security professionals. Researchers estimate more than 100 million internet-connected devices are vulnerable to a class of flaws dubbed NAME:WRECK. Devices ranging from smartphones, aircraft navigation systems and industrial internet of things (IIoT) endpoints are vulnerable to either a denial-of-service (DoS) or remote code-execution (RCE) attack, according to a joint report by Forescout Research Labs and JSOF Research Labs. Patches are available for some affected vendors. Nine vulnerabilities were identified within the implementation of the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol used by TCP/IP network communication stacks. These two technologies are used in tandem to uniquely identifying devices connected to the internet and facilitate digital communications between them. The most serious of the flaws are rated critical in severity.  \u201cThe widespread deployment and often external exposure of vulnerable DNS clients leads to a dramatically increased attack surface,\u201d researchers wrote in a report released Tuesday (PDF). \u201c[W]e can estimate that at least 100 million devices are impacted by NAME:WRECK.\u201d Breaking Down the NAME:WRECK Bugs Under the auspices of the research collective known as Project Memoria, NAME:WRECK is the fifth set of vulnerabilities impacting TCP/IP libraries that have been disclosed over the past three years. Those that have come before are URGENT/11, Ripple20, Amnesia:33 and NUMBER:JACK (also discovered by Project Memoria and Forescout). Forescout and JSOF researchers divide the nine NAME:WRECK vulnerabilities into four subcategories of devices dependent on the DNS and TCP/IP stacks (or firmware) used inside them. The categories include the FreeBSD, IPnet, Nucleus NET and NetX \u2013 each common in IoT and operational technology (OT) systems. Researchers said the origin of the name NAME:WRECK is based on \u201chow the parsing of domain names can break \u2013 \u2018wreck\u2019 \u2013 DNS implementations in TCP/IP stacks, leading to denial of service or remote code-execution.\u201d NAME:WRECK is similar to previous TCP/IP-DNS bugs that illustrate the complexity of the DNS protocol \u201cthat tends to yield vulnerable implementations,\u201d where bugs can often be leveraged by external attackers to take control of millions of devices simultaneously, researchers said. Unpacking a DNS Compression Bug One of the class of NAME:WRECK bugs are identified as DNS compression issues, impacting a wide range of devices that compress data used to communicate over the internet using TCP/IP. \u201cWith the first vulnerability, CVE-2020-27009, the attacker can craft a DNS response packet with a combination of invalid compression pointer offsets that allows them to write arbitrary data into sensitive parts of a device\u2019s memory, where they will then inject the code,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThe second vulnerability, CVE2020-15795, allows the attacker to craft meaningful code to be injected by abusing very large domain name records in the malicious packet. Finally, to deliver the malicious packet to the target, the attacker can bypass DNS query-response matching using CVE-2021-25667,\u201d they wrote. The technical specifics are complicated, but boil down to how a domain name (like Google.com) is encoded within the TCP/IP stack as a sequence of labels \u201cterminated by the NULL byte (0x00).\u201d This process of encoding and compressing domain names is meant to reduce the size of the DNS messages. However, hackers could exploit vulnerabilities within the TCP/IP stack to force the unpacking of compressed domain names in a malicious manner, opening the devices running the TCP/IP stack to come under attack. \u201cBy carefully choosing a combination of invalid compression offsets placed in a DNS packet, attackers can perform controlled out-of-bounds writes into the destination buffer \u2018dst,\u2019 potentially achieving remote code-execution,\u201d researchers wrote. As for the attack vector, researchers said, \u201cThe easiest way to construct a payload that will overflow name and overwrite heap metadata is to chain multiple domain labels.\u201d Researchers also identified other types of NAME:WRECK flaws, such as domain name label-parsing bugs, message-compression vulnerabilities and a VDomain name label-parsing bugs. The Nine NAME:WRECK Bugs The following are the vulnerability CVE tracking numbers and the type of TCP/IP stacks impacted: CVE-2020-7461: A message compression bug impacting devices running FreeBSD and can lead to RCE (CVSS severity rating 7.7); CVE-2016-20009: A message compression bug impacting devices running IPnet and can lead to RCE (CVSS severity rating 9.8); CVE-2020-15795: A domain name label-parsing bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to RCE (CVSS severity rating 8.1); CVE-2020-27009: A message-compression bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to RCE (CVSS severity rating 8.1); CVE-2020-27736: A VDomain name label-parsing bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to DoS (CVSS severity rating 6.5); CVE-2020-27737: A VDomain name label-parsing bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to DoS (CVSS severity rating 6.5); CVE-2020-27738: A message-compression bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to DoS (CVSS severity rating 6.5); CVE-2021-25677: A transaction-ID bug impacting devices running Nucleus NET and can lead to DNS cache-poisoning attacks (CVSS severity rating 5.3); And one CVE-unassigned: A message-compression bug impacting devices running NetX and can lead to DNS cache- poisoning attacks (CVSS severity rating 6.5). How Can Users Mitigate NAME:WRECK Bugs? Researchers are recommending that users and IT security staff discover and inventory devices running the vulnerable stacks. Forescout is making available an open-source script to fingerprint impacted devices. Researchers also recommended the implementation of device and network-segmentation controls and restricting external communication to vulnerable devices until they are patched or removed from the network; and of course, users should patch devices as fixes become available. Beyond that, users should configure vulnerable devices to run on internal DNS servers, and monitor network traffic for malicious packets attempting to exploit NAME:WRECK vulnerabilities or any bug affecting DNS, mDNS and DHCP clients.

"IBM introduced on Wednesday a new Cyber Range attack simulator during the opening of its global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. CAMBRIDGE, Ma. – IBM cut the ribbon on its new global security headquarters Wednesday that will also serve as command center for its just announced X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services. The centerpiece of the new 153,000-sqft facility is the company’s Cyber Range which IBM bills as a first-of-its kind commercial cyber-threat simulator. “This is a full-fledged cyber-security war room where we can put clients in the middle of a cyber threat and let them experience what it’s like and what it takes to defend against malware, APTs, DDoS and many other attacks,” Caleb Barlow, vice president of security at IBM, told Threatpost. Wendi Whitmore, global lead, of the newly created X-Force IRIS, said her team and the Cyber Range was an attempt to boost readiness for clients and any company faced with the ever-growing number of threats. Citing statistics from a Ponemon Institute study sponsored by IBM released Wednesday, she said that 75 percent of organizations have no formal cyber security incident response plan. “Cyber threats have been a reality for decades, but for organizations the risks have never been more prevalent. There are the actual risks and reputational damage that businesses face along with an increase in the regulations and notification requirements,” Whitmore told Threatpost. “The best way we see organizations maturing is practicing and testing and finding where security gaps are and closing them before companies actually have to face a real-life event.” That was a sentiment echoed by Lucy Ziobro, a section chief with the FBI Cyber Division, who spoke briefly at the opening event. “I have to go to a (gun) range four times a year to qualify my weapon and that’s something corporations should consider. When you deal with cyber threats, you have to practice it and get better,” she said. IBM’s Cyber Range consists of an air-gapped environment where participants take control of a fake Fortune 100 company. Over the course of a day-long simulated attack, clients are exposed to live malware, data exfiltration attempts and face real-world attack tools. The range consists of a dimly lit command center with three rows of 36 iMac workstations facing a massive 24-foot-by-6 foot LCD display. IBM says it has built a cloud, IoT, server and workstation environment for the mock company. On the backend is a massive air-gapped physical and virtual server and desktop environment. With the push of a button, IBM says, it can place up to a petabyte of data simulating the mock Fortune 100 company’s activities that can scale to thousands of servers. Barlow said the mock company can be easily morphed into a number of different sectors from banking, energy or manufacturing and can include firms with IoT devices and even supply chain partners. “In this environment we can control how much normal stuff is going on in the company,” he said. That includes events such as thousands of people sending and receiving emails, but also risky events such as employees losing passwords or having an iPhone lost or stolen. Through the course of the simulation, IBM injects attacks that simulate what an APT gang might use, or a DDoS attack such as the latest variant of the Mirai malware. “Based on the skill level of who is coming in, we can dial up or dial down the attack. But attacks play out based on the decisions the participants make. So if they make a bad call, we can see the consequences of that decision. On the same front, if we have a group of experienced operators we can throw a whole lot more at them as opposed to a bunch of C-level executives that have never had any exposure to a cyber threat before,” Barlow said, adding that this is the first at-scale simulator in the private sector. “These ranges do exist in the military and with military contractors, but those are focused on testing military tools,” Barlow said. “Nobody has ever done anything like this.” According to Barlow defensive tools aren’t limited to IBM solutions. “We can put any tools in there we want, including non-IBM tools. Clients can just as easily bring in a partners tool or a competitors tool. The reality is we all work in heterogeneous environments all the time and we want this simulation to be as real as possible.” But some attendees were skeptical about IBM’s unbiased approach. “I have never seen a more impressive lab for raising cyber readiness awareness against attacks. But I’m less convinced it’s going to be a place to learn about non-IBM competitive solutions,” said an IBM customer and IT security professional attending the event that asked not to be identified. Other security professionals said this will go a long way to convince C-level executives within organizations to understand the gap that exists between IT operations and their security teams. : Cloud Security Government Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1566 Phishing,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] IBM introduced on Wednesday a new Cyber Range attack simulator during the opening of its global security headquarters in Cambridge, Mass.

There are the actual risks and reputational damage that businesses face along with an increase in the regulations and notification requirements,” Whitmore told Threatpost. “The best way we see organizations maturing is practicing and testing and finding where security gaps are and closing them before companies actually have to face a real-life event.” That was a sentiment echoed by Lucy Ziobro, a section chief with the FBI Cyber Division, who spoke briefly at the opening event. “I have to go to a (gun) range four times a year to qualify my weapon and that’s something corporations should consider. When you deal with cyber threats, you have to practice it and get better,” she said. IBM’s Cyber Range consists of an air-gapped environment where participants take control of a fake Fortune 100 company. Over the course of a day-long simulated attack, clients are exposed to live malware, data exfiltration attempts and face real-world attack tools. The range consists of a dimly lit command center with three rows of 36 iMac workstations facing a massive 24-foot-by-6 foot LCD display. IBM says it has built a cloud, IoT, server and workstation environment for the mock company. On the backend is a massive air-gapped physical and virtual server and desktop environment. With the push of a button, IBM says, it can place up to a petabyte of data simulating the mock Fortune 100 company’s activities that can scale to thousands of servers. Barlow said the mock company can be easily morphed into a number of different sectors from banking, energy or manufacturing and can include firms with IoT devices and even supply chain partners. “In this environment we can control how much normal stuff is going on in the company,” he said. That includes events such as thousands of people sending and receiving emails, but also risky events such as employees losing passwords or having an iPhone lost or stolen. Through the course of the simulation, IBM injects attacks that simulate what an APT gang might use, or a DDoS attack such as the latest variant of the Mirai malware. “Based on the skill level of who is coming in, we can dial up or dial down the attack. But attacks play out based on the decisions the participants make. So if they make a bad call, we can see the consequences of that decision. On the same front, if we have a group of experienced operators we can throw a whole lot more at them as opposed to a bunch of C-level executives that have never had any exposure to a cyber threat before,” Barlow said, adding that this is the first at-scale simulator in the private sector. “These ranges do exist in the military and with military contractors, but those are focused on testing military tools,” Barlow said. “Nobody has ever done anything like this.” According to Barlow defensive tools aren’t limited to IBM solutions. “We can put any tools in there we want, including non-IBM tools. Clients can just as easily bring in a partners tool or a competitors tool. The reality is we all work in heterogeneous environments all the time and we want this simulation to be as real as possible.” But some attendees were skeptical about IBM’s unbiased approach. “I have never seen a more impressive lab for raising cyber readiness awareness against attacks. But I’m less convinced it’s going to be a place to learn about non-IBM competitive solutions,” said an IBM customer and IT security professional attending the event that asked not to be identified. Other security professionals said this will go a long way to convince C-level executives within organizations to understand the gap that exists between IT operations and their security teams. : Cloud Security Government Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1566 Phishing,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service </s>"
"A researcher has developed a bypass for Microsoft’s latest memory corruption mitigations in Internet Explorer, Heap Isolation and Delay Free. For a long time, Microsoft’s monthly Patch Tuesday security bulletins have periodically addressed use-after free vulnerabilities, the latest class of memory corruption bugs that have already found their way into a number of targeted attacks. Microsoft has implemented mitigations to address memory related vulnerabilities that afford successful attackers control over the underlying computer. Most notably, Microsoft has stood behind its Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, or EMET, suggesting it on several occasions as a temporary mitigation for a vulnerability until the company could push out a patch to users. Most recently, Microsoft brought new memory defenses to the browser, loading Internet Explorer with two new protections called Heap Isolation and Delayed Free, both of which take steps inside IE to frustrate and deny the execution of malicious code. Researchers have had a growing interest in bypassing EMET and memory protections for some time, with some successful bypasses disclosed and ultimately addressed by Microsoft. And until the Operation Snowman attacks, they were exclusively the realm of white hats—as far as we know publicly. As with the EMET protections, Heap Isolation and Delay Free were bound to attract some attention and last week at ShmooCon, a hacker conference in Washington, D.C., Bromium Labs principal security researcher Jared DeMott successfully demonstrated a bypass for both. DeMott’s bypass relies on what he termed a weakness in Microsoft’s approach with the new protections. With Heap Isolation, a new heap is created housing sensitive internal IE objects, while objects such as JavaScript likely to be targeted remain in the default heap, he said. DeMott’s bypass works through the use of what he calls a “long-lived dangling pointer.” Tweet “Thus if a UaF condition appears, the attacker should not be able to replace the memory of the dangling pointer with malicious data,” he wrote in a report published this week. This separation of good and bad data, however, isn’t realistic given the complexity of code and objects. Delayed Free then kicks in by delaying the release of an object to memory until there are no references to the object on the stack and 100,000 bytes are waiting to be freed, DeMott said. Taking advantage of these conditions, DeMott’s bypass works through the use of what he calls a “long-lived dangling pointer.” “If an attacker can locate a UaF bug that involves code that maintains a heap reference to a dangling pointer, the conditions to actually free the object under the deferred free protection can be met (no stack references or call chain eventually unwinds),” DeMott said. “And finding useful objects in either playground to replace the original turns out not to be that difficult either.” DeMott’s bypass is a Python script which searches IE for all objects, sizes and whether an object is allocated to the default or isolated heap. “This information can be used to help locate useful objects to attack either heap,” he wrote. “And with a memory garbage collection process known as coalescing the replacement object does not even have to be the same size as the original object.” DeMott said an attack would be similar to other client-side attacks. A victim would have to be lured to a website via phishing or a watering hole attack and be infected with the exploit. “If you have a working UaF bug, you have to make sure it’s of this long-live type and can basically upgrade it to an existing attack to bypasses these mitigations,” DeMott told Threatpost. “There’s no secret sauce, like every attack, it just depends on a good bug.” DeMott said he expects use-after-free to be the next iteration of memory corruption attacks. “There’s always a need [for attackers] to innovate,” DeMott said, pointing out that Microsoft deployed ASLR and DEP in response to years of buffer overflow and heap spray attacks, only to be thwarted by attackers with use-after-free vulnerabilities. “It’s starting to happen, it’s coming if it’s not already here.” : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] A researcher has developed a bypass for Microsoft’s latest memory corruption mitigations in Internet Explorer, Heap Isolation and Delay Free.

"Absolute Software’s anti-theft Computrace software is mysteriously installed on brand new machines, nearly impossible to remove, and exploitable. UPDATE: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Anibal Sacco works for Core Security. Sacco left Core Security last year to start Cubica Labs. LAS VEGAS – Nearly every PC has an anti-theft product called Computrace embedded in its BIOS PCI Optional ROM or its unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI). Computrace is a legitimate, trusted application developed by Absolute Software. However, it often runs without user-consent, persistently activates itself at system boot, and can be exploited to perform various attacks and to take complete control of an affected machine. Kaspersky Lab researchers Vitaly Kamluk and Sergey Belov along with Anibal Sacco of Cubica Labs earlier presented their research in a briefing titled “Absolute Computrace Revisited” six months ago at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit (SAS) in the Dominican Republic. They presented an updated version of that talk at Black Hat last week. Computrace should not be enabled by default. Absolute Software’s technical documentation says that Computrace should be enabled either by the user or by IT departments with admin control of work machines. In fact, to this point, Kamluk, Sacco and Belov can only guess at how Computrace is enabled by default on many out-of-the-box PCs. At present they believe the software is being unintentionally initiated by manufacturers. Furthermore, once Computrace is enabled, it is incredibly persistent and very difficult to remove or even turn off. “We believe that persistence was erroneously activated,” Kamluk and Saccco said. “It could be a bug in this tool or a human error. We don’t think this bug was introduced on purpose.” One of the problems – as was highlighted at SAS – is that Computrace does not enforce encryption when it communicates and it does not verify the identity of the remote server from which it receives commands. This is particularly irksome given how Computrace works: first the persistence modules in BIOS/UEFI update a system’s default autochk.exe. Then the new autochk.exe drops and registers a new system service called rpcnetp. Rpcnetp, in turn, talks to the Absolute server and is replaced by rcpnet, which is a core remote administration module that is restored if the user deletes it. In other words, the way Computrace interacts with Absolute could expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks. Back in February, Kamluk described Computrace’s exploitability as follows: “The software is extremely flexible. It’s a tiny piece of code which is a part of the BIOS. As far as it is a piece of the BIOS, it is not very easy to update the software as often. So they made it very extensible. It can do nearly anything. It can run every type of code. You can do to the system whatever you want. Considering that the software is running on these local system privileges, you have full access to the machine. You can wipe the machine, you can monitor it, you can look through the webcam, you can actually copy any files, you can start new processes. You can do absolutely anything.” [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8-7EErqpM&w=640&h=360] A half year later, Computrace remains exploitable. In addition to that, Kamluk’s presentation at Black Hat last week included the disclosure of a new remote code execution vulnerability, a demonstration of how Computrace can be used as a removal-resistant backdoor capable of bypassing security software, and an examination of how Computrace is running on so many machines. The mystery regarding who or what is activating Computrace remains unsolved. However, forensic analyses of affected computers show what Computrace dates back to the first system boot. Deeper analysis of a brand new machine on which Computrace was not enabled may hint at how the anti-theft product is ending up on machines automatically. Kamluk and Sacco believe that manufacturers may run tests on newly made machines checking for compatibility with Computrace. They managed to extract the test and run it themselves: First the test would activate BIOS/UEFI dropper, which launches the application. Next the test reboots the system and checks that rpcnetp.exe is running, which is integral to Comptrace’s persistence. The third and operative step is to deactivate BIOS/UEFI dropper. Finally, the test reboots and checks that rpcnetp.exe is not running. When Sacco and Kamluk simulated the test, it crashed out during the third step, meaning it failed to remove the mechanism that initiates Computrace. Absolute Software, according to the researchers, has promised to address these “security issues,” though the company “denied the existence of vulnerabilities in its products.” Kamluk and Sacco noted in their Black Hat talk that Computrace, though it acts like malware in a number of ways, is not detected by antivirus engines. And there are a number of good reasons for that, not the least of which is that Computrace is a well-known piece of software that is whitelisted by most antivirus companies, trusted by large numbers of hardware companies and developed by a legitimate business. The problem with Computrace isn’t that it’s outright malicious, but rather that vulnerabilities in it can turn the useful tool into a powerful weapon for cybercriminals. Rpcnetp.exe can be easily patched to provide an under-the-radar connect back method in a system without Computrace. In a system with Computrace, they say the situation is even worse, because rpcnet.exe is signed but depends on the registry configuration block, so it can be redirected with no binary modification. “At 2009 [Black Hat] talk we released a tool to demonstrate redirection of (signed) rpcnet.exe through registry modification,” the researchers explained in a slide deck. “With a small modification, it still works. With this attack, all the Computrace persistency features will be turned against the user, by giving control to the attacker. This provides an attacker with a disguised connect back method in a Computrace deployed system.” The modified rpcnet executables can be detected by antivirus engines, but because of white-listing, the executables are not blocked. “We have no reasons to think that Absolute Software or any PC manufacturers secretly activate persistence, but it’s clear that if there are a lot of computers with activated Computrace agents, it is the responsibility of the manufacturers and Absolute Software to notify those users and explain how they can deactivate it if they don’t want to use Absolute Software services. Otherwise, these orphaned agents will keep on running unnoticed and provide opportunities for remote exploitation.” Image via Black Hat USA 2014 : Mobile Security Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job","<s>[INST] Absolute Software’s anti-theft Computrace software is mysteriously installed on brand new machines, nearly impossible to remove, and exploitable.

"Mozilla released a new version of Firefox on Wednesday to address a zero day vulnerability that was actively being exploited to de-anonymize Tor Browser users. As expected, Mozilla released a new version of Firefox on Wednesday to address a zero-day vulnerability that was actively being exploited to de-anonymize Tor Browser users. The vulnerability, disclosed on a public Tor Project mailing list late Tuesday night, forced the Tor Project to also issue an emergency update (6.0.7) in its Tor Browser – which is partially built on open source Firefox code – on Wednesday. According to Daniel Veditz, who leads Mozilla’s security team, Firefox users should have their browsers automatically updated at some point over the next 24 hours. If they’d rather not wait, users can download the updated versions – Firefox 50.0.2, Firefox ESR 45.5.1, and Thunderbird 45.5.1. – manually. The issue, a use-after-free vulnerability, technically existed in an object, nsSMILTimeContainer, which is used to facilitate SVG animation in Firefox. Assuming an attacker could trick a user into visiting specially-crafted web content, they could have leveraged the vulnerability to remotely execute arbitrary code on the system. Veditz said Wednesday afternoon that because of the way the vulnerability behaved, it was collecting and forwarding IP and MAC addresses thought to be private and forwarding them back to a central server. “The exploit took advantage of a bug in Firefox to allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system by having the victim load a web page containing malicious JavaScript and SVG code. It used this capability to collect the IP and MAC address of the targeted system and report them back to a central server. While the payload of the exploit would only work on Windows, the vulnerability exists on Mac OS and Linux as well,” Veditz wrote. Veditz acknowledged many security researchers surmised on Twitter Wednesday that the way ToR vulnerability worked was similar to the way the FBI de-anonymized Tor users in 2013. While Veditz stopped short of saying the exploit was created by the FBI or law enforcement, he did float the idea and warned how it could pose a serious threat to privacy. “As of now, we do not know whether this is the case.

"Philippines COVID-KAYA app allowed for unauthorized access typically protected by ‘superuser’ credentials and also may have exposed patient data. A platform used by healthcare workers in the Philippines designed to share data about COVID-19 cases contained multiple flaws that exposed healthcare worker data and could potentially could have leaked patient data. Vulnerabilities found in both the COVID-KAYA platform’s web and Android apps allowed for unauthorized users to access private data about the platform’s users and potentially patient data, according to a report from researchers at the The Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto. The Citizen Lab’s report is the latest example of how the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a host of security problems for the healthcare sector to deal with – including securing data and ransomware attacks. In addition to opportunistic threat actors using the pandemic and related issues for their own gain in socially engineered phishing and other campaigns, the flood of new data related to the pandemic is also testing the security of systems used to store and share this data. COVID-KAYA was deployed on June 2 to allow frontline healthcare workers in the Philippines to automate their collection and sharing of coronavirus case information with the country’s Department of Health. The app has web, iOS and Android versions and was built using Cordova, a cross-platform application development framework that allows developers to build applications using web technologies and then deploy the same code to both web and mobile platforms. “Our analysis found that both of these versions of COVID-KAYA contain vulnerabilities disclosing data otherwise protected by ‘superuser’ credentials,” according to the report, written by Citizen Lab’s Pellaeon Lin, Jeffrey Knockel, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, Stephanie Tran, and Ron Deibert. Researchers point to two vulnerabilities that have since been patched—one in the COVID-KAYA web app and another in the Android app—that attackers could have exploited to expose sensitive data from the system. The web app’s flaw resided in its authentication logic. The vulnerability allowed “otherwise restricted access to API endpoints, exposing the names and locations of health centers as well as the names of over 30,000 healthcare providers who have signed up to use the app,” researchers said. They also said the app could have exposed sensitive patient data, although this remains unconfirmed. Meanwhile, the COVID-KAYA Android app used hardcoded API credentials that also allowed access to the names of healthcare providers and potentially sensitive patient data as well, researchers wrote. The Citizen Lab team disclosed the web app vulnerability to the app’s developers—including officials from Dure Technologies, the Philippines Department of Health, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines–on Aug. 18, and the Android app’s vulnerability on Sept.14. Both flaws have been identified and patched as of Oct. 29, and any leaked credentials have been invalidated, researchers confirmed. The authentication flaw in the web app stemmed from a login page used to authenticate valid users with a username and password. At first sight it appeared that the page functioned normally; if someone signed in with an invalid username and/or password, it let the person know, researchers reported. “However, in our testing, we found that, after attempting to sign in with an invalid username or password, the web app appeared to grant us, without notification, access to API endpoints and tools normally unavailable to users who were not logged in,” researchers wrote. “These API endpoints and tools were easily discoverable.” For example, the team discovered an API endpoint by taking the publicly accessible end point for resetting a user’s forgotten password and then deleting part of the URL. The new URL redirected them to a page that appeared to be a master directory of API endpoints, one of which seemed capable of enumerating all enumerating all 30,087 (at the time of access) users of the app, researchers said. Further modification of the URL allowed them to access the system and view all the health centers and healthcare providers were affiliated with the app, as organized by country and city, as well as access other sensitive data, researchers said. In their analysis of the COVID-KAYA Android app version 1.4.7, researchers found a flaw in how a source file of the app’s source code handled hard-coded credentials used for accessing the web interface of the system’s dashboard. The vulnerability could be used to access sensitive data from API endpoints by allowing unauthorized log-in to the log in to the dashboard, researchers said. Two weeks ago, another COVID-19-related data breach occurred when a cyber-attack hit COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, the contractor for Russia’s “Sputinik V” COVID-19 vaccine, which is about to enter Phase 2 human trials. The company shut down its plants in Brazil, India, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S. as well as isolated data-centers services to apply remediations. Hackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare: On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020. ",T1082 System Information Discovery,"<s>[INST] Philippines COVID-KAYA app allowed for unauthorized access typically protected by ‘superuser’ credentials and also may have exposed patient data. A platform used by healthcare workers in the Philippines designed to share data about COVID-19 cases contained multiple flaws that exposed healthcare worker data and could potentially could have leaked patient data. Vulnerabilities found in both the COVID-KAYA platform’s web and Android apps allowed for unauthorized users to access private data about the platform’s users and potentially patient data, according to a report from researchers at the The Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the University of Toronto. The Citizen Lab’s report is the latest example of how the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a host of security problems for the healthcare sector to deal with – including securing data and ransomware attacks. In addition to opportunistic threat actors using the pandemic and related issues for their own gain in socially engineered phishing and other campaigns, the flood of new data related to the pandemic is also testing the security of systems used to store and share this data. COVID-KAYA was deployed on June 2 to allow frontline healthcare workers in the Philippines to automate their collection and sharing of coronavirus case information with the country’s Department of Health. The app has web, iOS and Android versions and was built using Cordova, a cross-platform application development framework that allows developers to build applications using web technologies and then deploy the same code to both web and mobile platforms. “Our analysis found that both of these versions of COVID-KAYA contain vulnerabilities disclosing data otherwise protected by ‘superuser’ credentials,” according to the report, written by Citizen Lab’s Pellaeon Lin, Jeffrey Knockel, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, Stephanie Tran, and Ron Deibert. Researchers point to two vulnerabilities that have since been patched—one in the COVID-KAYA web app and another in the Android app—that attackers could have exploited to expose sensitive data from the system. The web app’s flaw resided in its authentication logic. The vulnerability allowed “otherwise restricted access to API endpoints, exposing the names and locations of health centers as well as the names of over 30,000 healthcare providers who have signed up to use the app,” researchers said. They also said the app could have exposed sensitive patient data, although this remains unconfirmed. Meanwhile, the COVID-KAYA Android app used hardcoded API credentials that also allowed access to the names of healthcare providers and potentially sensitive patient data as well, researchers wrote. The Citizen Lab team disclosed the web app vulnerability to the app’s developers—including officials from Dure Technologies, the Philippines Department of Health, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines–on Aug. 18, and the Android app’s vulnerability on Sept.14. Both flaws have been identified and patched as of Oct. 29, and any leaked credentials have been invalidated, researchers confirmed. The authentication flaw in the web app stemmed from a login page used to authenticate valid users with a username and password. At first sight it appeared that the page functioned normally; if someone signed in with an invalid username and/or password, it let the person know, researchers reported. “However, in our testing, we found that, after attempting to sign in with an invalid username or password, the web app appeared to grant us, without notification, access to API endpoints and tools normally unavailable to users who were not logged in,” researchers wrote. “These API endpoints and tools were easily discoverable.” For example, the team discovered an API endpoint by taking the publicly accessible end point for resetting a user’s forgotten password and then deleting part of the URL. The new URL redirected them to a page that appeared to be a master directory of API endpoints, one of which seemed capable of enumerating all enumerating all 30,087 (at the time of access) users of the app, researchers said. Further modification of the URL allowed them to access the system and view all the health centers and healthcare providers were affiliated with the app, as organized by country and city, as well as access other sensitive data, researchers said. In their analysis of the COVID-KAYA Android app version 1.4.7, researchers found a flaw in how a source file of the app’s source code handled hard-coded credentials used for accessing the web interface of the system’s dashboard. The vulnerability could be used to access sensitive data from API endpoints by allowing unauthorized log-in to the log in to the dashboard, researchers said.

"Reading Time: 4 minutes On April 26th, Microsoft revealed that hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in their Internet Explorer browser to victimize users with so called “drive by download” attacks. Such attacks download and execute malicious software on the victim’s computer, often for the purpose of committing financial fraud. According to Microsoft, the problem is a remote code execution vulnerability and involves the way IE accesses an object in memory that has been deleted or has not been properly allocated. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user within Internet Explorer. In a drive by download scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website where malicious software will be downloaded to their computer. It is important to note that until a patch is available from Microsoft, the vulnerability exists on all versions of IE going back to IE 6 and for all versions of Windows from XP forward.  As of this minute, essentially all IE Windows users are vulnerable. Microsoft does not usually release patches outside of their normal schedule, but will rush a fix out because the next regularly-scheduled patch is Tuesday is May 13, just over two weeks away. When Microsoft eventually provides a patch, it will only be for Windows Vista and higher. Windows XP users will be left in the cold, unless they or their organization pay for a very expensive extended support contract. As of March, 28% of all desktops were operating with Windows XP. Regardless of what version of Windows you are using, you will be protected from such Drive by Downloads if you use Comodo security and run your browser in the sandbox, aka virtual browsing, or use the Virtual Desktop which provides a virtual environment for all of your activities. The sandbox is a secure system area isolated from the rest of the operating system. Any malicious files you download will be contained where they cannot harm your computer or your file system. With Comodo Internet Security installed, you can run a browser in the sandbox or easily switch from their regular desktop to the Virtual Desktop, fully secure virtual environment.  The following are various ways to browse secure with Comodo Internet Security and sandboxing.

"Reading Time: 4 minutes Cybercriminals fond of celebration dates like Thanksgiving Day — but not for the same reason that upstanding people do. For the perpetrators, it’s the favorite time to attack. Why? Because people are tuned on pleasant and good thoughts and feelings on such days. Unfortunately, it makes them more vulnerable. When they see a greeting letter in the inboxes, they feel gratitude and curiosity — who sent it?—and click on the attached file without thinking about potential danger. On the eve of this Thanksgiving day Comodo specialists intercepted a cunning attack aimed at propagating one of the currently most nefarious malware – Emotet trojan, usually used for stealing banking credentials and other private information. Usually this malware spread mostly as a finance-related email like a message from a bank. Here is an example of such email intercepted by Comodo facilities. As you can see, the attackers used well-prepared fake able to deceive even security aware user. The link in the email leads to “rozdroza.com/En_us/Clients_Messages/11_18” URL. If a user clicks the link, the poisoned Microsoft Office document file automatically drops on her machine. But on the eve of the Thanksgiving day the perpetrators decided to make something special and disguise the infected file as a greeting card. Below are the samples of the phishing emails they are using in the new attack.  As you can see, these emails are also carefully worked out to look plausible. They have different content but in every case it’s build to inspire pleasant and warm emotions in the victims. Be it a hearty greeting, admiration of a colleague or even a piece of poetry, it arouses a good mood in the victims, thus weakening their vigilance. The quotes of great people at the bottom of the messages also used to inspire trust in the victims, raising chances they will open the document – and let the enemy in the house. In reality, the “greeting card” is a Word document infected with Emotet. Let’s look at the whole killing chain of this cunning malware. The infected file has embedded Macro script. When a user opens a “greeting card”, the macros downloads Emotet on the victim’s machine.   First, the user is instructed to enable the execution of Macro content as the document contains a VBA stream designed to download and execute the malware.  If the user allows the active content to run, the code will call cmd.exe with modified parameters that will again call cmd.exe with obfuscated parameters that, finally, pass a script to powershell.exe designed to download and run binaries from the internet. The obfuscated parameters used to launch cmd.exe are stored in a textbox that is resized to be unnoticeable for the victim.  After that, the script probes five locations to download Emotet: anora71.uz/aH3i9EM, egyptmotours.com/EfRRkqPucD, friskyeliquid.com/xspcYyA63, m3produtora.com/QOlBVnrL40, litsey4.ru/V5XLXxDubY. Then it downloads the malware to the user’s Temporary folder and executes it. Emotet moves itself to C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\cachingplain.exe and creates a service to run during system startup.  The newly created service connects to the C&C server to notify availability and receive commands. From this moment, the infected machine is under total control of the attackers. They can extract the users’ credential, banking and other private information from the PC and continue the attack by downloading other types of malware. “The attack is a complicated poisoned merge of refined well-disguised malware and psychological manipulation tricks”, says Fatih Orhan, The Head of Comodo Threat Research Labs. “It’s not only dangerous and destroying from the technical point of view but especially cynic and immoral because of exploiting peoples’ bright feelings in a grand holiday. It’s always bad to be robbed but it’s much worse to be robbed in such a great holiday and aware that perpetrators used your own bright feelings against you.

"The PowerPool gang launched its attack just two days after the zero-day in the Windows Task Scheduler was disclosed. The recently discovered Windows zero-day – which still doesn’t have a patch – has been used in the wild for the last week, with an active info-stealing campaign emerging just two days after its disclosure on Twitter. The flaw is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Task Scheduler’s Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) interface — it allows a local unprivileged user to change the permissions of any file on the system and modify it, including system files that are executed by privileged processes. Security researcher “SandboxEscaper” spilled the beans on the flaw on August 27 with some amount of frustration in the vulnerability reporting process: “I don’t [redacted] care about life anymore. Neither do I ever again want to submit to MSFT anyway,” the researcher said in a since-deleted tweet, while linking to a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code on GitHub. The PoC was straightforward: “SandboxEscaper’s PoC specifically overwrites a printing-related DLL to make it launch notepad.exe, then triggers the Print Spooler service (spoolsv.exe) to load the DLL,” explained researchers at Barkly, in a blog about the newly-discovered exploit posted Wednesday. “As a result, notepad.exe is spawned as SYSTEM.” The PoC feature full source code, thus lowering the malware development bar considerably; most PoCs offer only compiled code, which would require reverse-engineering on the part of bad actors. “It was easy for PowerPool developers to integrate the exploit into their code,” Matthieu Faou, malware researcher at ESET, told Threatpost. “The reverse-engineering of an exploit is generally highly time-consuming.” So perhaps it’s no surprise that within two days, the PowerPool gang, a known threat group, had modified the PoC to gain write access to the GoogleUpdate.exe function, which is the legitimate updater for Google applications. As such, it runs with admin privileges. According to researchers at ESET, PowerPool has replaced the updater with a malicious executable that is thus launched with elevated privileges whenever the updater is called. The Campaign According to ESET researchers, the PowerPool group initially compromises victims via spear-phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The emails use a typical “you have not settled this invoice” lure. That attachment – no word on the format, but PowerPool has used tricky Symbolic Link (.slk) file attachments in the past  – is a first-stage malware with two Windows executables, used for reconnaissance on the machine. The main executable is a backdoor that establishes persistence and collects basic machine and proxy information; it then exfiltrates the data to the command-and-control (C2) server. ESET said that it can also execute commands. The other executable only does one thing: It takes a screenshot of the victim’s display and sends it to the C2. If the attackers decide that the victim machine looks like a good prize, the first-stage backdoor fetches a second-stage malware, which is more rudimentary than the usual APT backdoor, ESET researchers noted. However, it uses the zero-day exploit to elevate its privileges to system admin, which gives the attackers an unfettered view to other parts of the network. The team found that the second-stage code thus downloads an array of open-source lateral-movement tools, mostly written in PowerShell. Among other things, these can retrieve usernames and hashes from the Security Account Manager (SAM); perform pass-the-hash SMB connections; retrieve Windows credentials; and lift stored passwords from Outlook, web browsers and so on. More to Come The campaign is limited for now, according to ESET telemetry, which may indicate that the recipients are carefully chosen rather than on the receiving end of a mass-mailing spam effort. However, it’s unlikely to be the only use of the zero-day by threat groups. “The disclosure of vulnerabilities outside of a coordinated disclosure process generally puts many users at risk,” ESET researchers noted in their analysis posted on Wednesday. “This specific campaign targets a limited number of users, but don’t be fooled by that: it shows that cybercriminals also follow the news and work on employing exploits as soon as they are publicly available.” Users should be on high alert: CERT-CC has confirmed that all supported Windows versions are vulnerable. “Windows has a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost last week. “Our standard policy is to provide solutions via our current Update Tuesday schedule.” While Microsoft has yet to roll out a patch (one could be upcoming in September’s Patch Tuesday), a third-party “micropatch” is available from 0Patch for 64-bit versions of Windows 7, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2016.

Vick found a zero-day flaw in the chain’s in-room Tapia robots that would allow a guest to establish the equivalent of a backdoor that would give them access to video and audio streams remotely, on an ongoing basis, in order to spy on the guests that stay in the room after them. It’s unclear whether anyone other than Vick actually compromised the devices, but Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at Thycotic, told Threatpost that the potential for malicious activity extends beyond voyeurism. “Anything that is connected to the internet, whether it be a laptop, phone, webcam or even a hospitality robot, are all exposed to the risk of being hacked and abused,” he said. “Devices that contain cameras used for simple functions, such as motion sensors, can absolutely be abused to record video, analyze that data and perform voice or facial recognition….While that data can be used to abuse privacy of the occupants of the hotels, when we add technology such as machine intelligence [or artificial intelligence], then it can get catastrophic in the future when we add the risks of deep fakes that can then turn this data into complete digital identity theft.  We need to approach the future with caution and responsibility and embrace technology.” Vick reported the zero-day to the vendor in July, but that the vendor “didn’t care.” The bug exists thanks to unsigned code that opens up access to a near field communication (NFC) tag inside the robot. An NFC tag is a small microchip with content embedded on it that can be read by in-range mobile devices – that range is mere inches, so generally, NFC content is read by “tapping” a smartphone on an NFC reader. Tags can also be programmed to launch a URL or connect to applications (“tap to pay” mechanisms at stores are based on NFC). Thus, Vick said that exploitation of the robot bug is trivial and requires a minor amount of NFC tag reprogramming – made possible because of the unsigned code. Vick noted on Twitter that an attacker would need to “tap an NFC tag to the back of the [robot’s] head with any URL which breaks out of the ‘jail’; go to settings, allow untrusted apps; use browser to install streaming audio/video app of choice; set to autorun; reboot; watch stream remote whenever you want. It is that easy.” “Finding an unsecured NFC tag inside the device was so deceptively simple it highlights how bad [internet of things] IoT device manufacturers really are at security,” Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, told Threatpost. “I’m not a fan of regulation, but in this case, until some form of base, minimum security standards exist for IoT device manufacturers, we will continue to see these kind of tricks. These aren’t even hacks. They are poorly configured devices with glaring security and privacy weaknesses.” Reportedly, HIS apologized and said that “a modification has been made to prevent exploits by guests, reports TV Asahi,” according to the Tokyo Reporter. The outlet also reported that the manufacturer of the Tapia robots determined that “the risk of unauthorized access was low,” despite the assessment of the researcher. “If I were staying at a hotel that had a robot with facial recognition and video cameras I would throw a towel over its head,” Morales told Threatpost. “IoT device manufacturers have a horrible track record for securing access to their devices. Installing one in the name of convenience that happens to also be able to record everything I do in what is supposedly a private room is creepy.” Researchers noted that situations like this are only sure to become more common as IoT proliferates. “We end up in a situation that is new to humanity, one where we are monitored more aggressively than our predecessors imagined, and not by central authorities but by criminals,” said Thomas Hatch, CTO and co-founder at SaltStack, speaking to Threatpost. “We can say with a level of confidence that the known hacks of such devices are just the tip of the iceberg.

"A kid’s tablet with security vulnerabilities is only the latest privacy faux pas in a children’s connected device. LAS VEGAS – IoT devices are increasingly coming into the hands of children – from connected watches, to Amazon Echo smart speakers – but security experts worry that these are opening up children’s data to future privacy breaches. The latest example of this fear was seen at Black Hat 2019, where serious vulnerabilities were disclosed in LeapFrog’s tablet for kids, the LeapPad Ultimate. Erez Yalon, director of security research at Checkmarx, who disclosed the flaws at Black Hat 2019 on Wednesday, said the tablet has a number of security issues opening the door to a slew of malicious activities by an adversary. Those include allowing bad actors to track the devices, send messages to children or launch man-in-the-middle attacks. It’s only the latest children’s toy to have issues around security and privacy. After CloudPets connected teddy bears were found to have exposed 2.2 million voice recordings between parents and their children in a significant data breach, Amazon, Target and Walmart have pulled the toys from their online markets. Genesis Toys’ My Friend Cayla doll (which was banned in Germany) and Mattel’s Hello Barbie doll have also undergone major security issues. “I think that the vendors and manufacturers need to understand that creating devices for users that are under age, it means two things,” Yalon told Threatpost. “First of all, it means that the target is more problematic. I think that the results might be more catastrophic. Also, we’re dealing here with users that are sometimes not really aware of the safety needed.” For a full video of Threatpost’s interview with Yalon, see below.

"CVE-2019-11043 is trivial to exploit — and a proof of concept is available. A buffer underflow bug in PHP could allow remote code-execution (RCE) on targeted NGINX servers. First discovered during a hCorem Capture the Flag competition in September, the bug (CVE-2019-11043) exists in the FastCGI directive used in some PHP implementations on NGINX servers, according to researchers at Wallarm. PHP powers about 30 percent of modern websites, including popular web platforms like WordPress and Drupal – but NGINX servers are only vulnerable if they have PHP-FPM enabled (a non-default optimization feature that allows servers to execute scripts faster). The issue is patched in PHP versions 7.3.11, 7.2.24 and 7.1.33, which were released last week. In a Monday posting, Wallarm researchers said that the bug can be exploited by sending specially crafted packets to the server by using the “fastcgi_split_path” directive in the NGINX configuration file. That file is configured to process user data, such as a URL. If an attacker creates a special URL that includes a “%0a” (newline) byte, the server will send back more data than it should, which confuses the FastCGI mechanism. “In particular, [the bug can be exploited] in a fastcgi_split_path directive and a regexp trick with newlines,” according to Wallarm security researcher Andrew Danau, who found the bug. “Because of %0a character, NGINX will set an empty value to this variable, and fastcgi+PHP will not expect this….[as a result], it’s possible to put [in] arbitrary FastCGI variables, like PHP_VALUE.” Another security researcher participating in the CTF exercise, Emil Lerner, offered more details in the PHP bug tracker: “The regexp in `fastcgi_split_path_info` directive can be broken using the newline character (in encoded form, %0a). Broken regexp leads to empty PATH_INFO, which triggers the bug,” he said. Lerner posted a zero-day proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw that works in PHP 7 to allow code execution. The exploit makes use of an optimization used for storing FastCGI variables, _fcgi_data_seg. “Usually, that sort of [buffer underflow] response is related to memory-corruption attacks and we expected to see an attack on the type of information disclosure,” Wallarm researchers said. “Information disclosure is bad enough as it can result in leaking sensitive or financial data. Even worse, from time to time, although quite rarely, such behavior can indicate a remote code-execution vulnerability.” Researchers added that without patching, this issue can be a dangerous entry point into web applications given the trivial nature of mounting an exploit. Admins can identify vulnerable FastCGI directives in their NGINX configurations with a bash command, “egrep -Rin –color ‘fastcgi_split_path’ /etc/nginx/,” according to Wallarm.

"Cisco has issued a fix for a critical flaw in its Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS), software for optimizing WAN on virtual private cloud infrastructure. Cisco patched a critical flaw in its wide area network (WAN) software solution for enterprises, which if exploited could give remote, unauthenticated attackers administrator privileges. The flaw exists in Cisco Virtual Wide Area Application Services (vWAAS), which is software that Cisco describes as a “WAN optimization solution.” It helps manage business applications that are being leveraged in virtual private cloud infrastructure. The flaw (CVE-2020-3446), which has a critical-severity CVSS score of 9.8 out of 10, exists because user accounts for accessing the software contain default passwords. That means an attacker could log in, via a default password, and thus potentially obtain administrator privileges. “The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory,” according to Cisco’s Wednesday advisory. vWAAS is hosted in compute appliances called Cisco Enterprise Network Compute Series (ENCS). These appliances are also used to deploy the Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS), a software platform that implements full lifecycle management from the central orchestrator and controller for virtualized services. This vulnerability specifically affects Cisco ENCS 5400-W Series and CSP 5000-W Series appliances if they are running Cisco vWAAS with NFVIS-bundled image releases 6.4.5, or 6.4.3d and earlier.  The flaw is fixed in Cisco vWAAS with NFVIS-bundled image release 6.4.3e, 6.4.5a, and later releases. While an attacker could be unauthenticated and remote, in order to exploit this vulnerability, they would need to be able to connect to the NFVIS command line interface (CLI) on an affected device. This would require access to one of the following: The Ethernet management port for the CPU on an affected ENCS 5400-W Series appliance. The first port on the four-port I350 PCIe Ethernet Adapter card on an affected CSP 5000-W Series appliance. A connection to the vWAAS software CLI and a valid user credential to authenticate on the vWAAS CLI first. Or a connection to the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC) interface of the ENCS 5400-W Series or CSP 5000-W Series appliance (and a valid user credential to authenticate to the CIMC first). Cisco on Wednesday also issued patches for two high-severity vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-3506, CVE-2020-3507) in its Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP cameras, which could enable remote code execution and denial of services (DoS). “Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP camera,” according to Cisco. And, a high-severity flaw (CVE-2020-3443) found and fixed in Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute commands with higher privileges. It’s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks – whether it’s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

"CVEs or Software vulnerabilities comprise only a part of security risks in the IT security landscape. Attack surfaces are massive with numerous security risks that must be treated equally as software vulnerabilities to reduce risk exposure and prevent cyberattacks at scale A software vulnerability is a weakness in an operating system or application that can be exploited by an attacker to invade an IT network. When publicly disclosed, these software vulnerabilities are usually assigned a CVE identifier. CVE is a popular term when referring to a vulnerability, and 50 to 60 CVEs are discovered every day on average. Clearly, vulnerabilities are increasing rapidly, challenging IT security teams. Furthermore, over 40% of discovered vulnerabilities have no CVE identifier assigned and can be easily exploited by cybercriminals. These vulnerability loopholes allow unauthorized access to the network, resulting in ransomware and malware attacks. IT Security teams must implement a seamless vulnerability management process to prevent cyber attacks. They should continuously identify the vulnerabilities in their network, assess them thoroughly, prioritize them based on their severity, remediate them with relevant patches, and report all the data for strategic analysis. It’s evident that CVEs or software vulnerabilities are a critical security loophole, but are these the only form of vulnerabilities attackers’ look out for? To answer this, we need to rethink vulnerabilities from the standpoint of an entire attack surface. Are Software Vulnerabilities the Only Vulnerability in the Attack Surface? CVEs or software vulnerabilities contribute only to a part of security risks in the IT vulnerability landscape. The attack surface comprises numerous vulnerabilities from a misconfigured firewall policy, unavailability of antivirus, unauthorized applications, lack of visibility over scheduled tasks, unwanted services and ports, hidden assets, and publicly discoverable files to numerous security control deviations and anomalies. All these vulnerabilities and security risks are as threatening as a software vulnerability and can easily open gateways for an array of cyberattacks. IT security teams should look beyond CVEs and software vulnerabilities and start managing these security risks to attain a strong security posture and combat attacks. Top Security Risks in the IT Security Landscape Here are the top security risks that are as threatening as a software vulnerability and need to be considered as a vulnerability in the IT security landscape. Software Vulnerabilities: Software vulnerabilities are an IT network’s most critical security risks. Although they receive a lot of attention from security teams, they are still prevalent in huge numbers inside a typical IT infrastructure. While managing the other security risks, IT security teams must bring in a continuous and automated process to quickly detect and remediate software vulnerabilities. Misconfigurations: Security misconfigurations are inaccurately configured settings that leave an organization’s IT infrastructure at risk. Although security misconfigurations are not a part of an application or an operating system, they control the settings that make applications and operating systems run. For instance, a weak system password or weak encryption is a security misconfiguration that can open doors for numerous attacks, including brute force attacks. IT Asset Exposures: IT security teams should have complete and continuous visibility over the IT infrastructure. Any malicious entry of IT assets will disrupt security to a large extent. For instance, using unauthorized applications or devices will cause a huge threat to an organization’s security, inviting attacks like data thefts. Likewise, shadow IT, end-of-life and end-of-support software, and unwanted ports and services must be identified in the network and worked upon. Missing security patches: Missing patches are one of the crucial security risks in an IT network. Many attacks, including the infamous WannaCry ransomware, were due to a missing patch that was not applied on time. Apart from fixing vulnerabilities, patches play an important role in keeping systems stable, up-to-date, and safe from cyberattacks. It is essential to patch all operating systems and third-party applications continuously to safeguard your network from potential attacks. Deviation in security controls: Numerous security controls must be implemented in a device for adequate security. If these security controls are not configured properly, they might lead to security mishaps. For example, crucial security controls like antivirus and firewall should always be enabled. Any error in these settings or even if they are accidentally disabled, it serves as an alarming security loophole in an IT network. Like the above security risks, security deviations and posture anomalies are present in an IT infrastructure that are as alarming as a software vulnerability. Attack surface reduction cannot be achieved only by managing CVEs. All the vulnerabilities and security risks discussed above must be managed rigorously to minimize attack surfaces and combat cyberattacks. Again, opting for different solutions to manage all these vulnerabilities and security risks will only create chaos and complexities. IT security teams should start looking for a solution that automatically detects and remediates vulnerabilities, IT asset exposures, misconfigurations, security control deviations, and posture anomalies from a single place. Only a tool that treats all these vulnerabilities equally can meet today’s IT security demands and pave the way for a threat-free IT landscape. : News Vulnerabilities","T1082 System Information Discovery ,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter ,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation ,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job","<s>[INST] CVEs or Software vulnerabilities comprise only a part of security risks in the IT security landscape.

For instance, a weak system password or weak encryption is a security misconfiguration that can open doors for numerous attacks, including brute force attacks. IT Asset Exposures: IT security teams should have complete and continuous visibility over the IT infrastructure. Any malicious entry of IT assets will disrupt security to a large extent. For instance, using unauthorized applications or devices will cause a huge threat to an organization’s security, inviting attacks like data thefts. Likewise, shadow IT, end-of-life and end-of-support software, and unwanted ports and services must be identified in the network and worked upon. Missing security patches: Missing patches are one of the crucial security risks in an IT network. Many attacks, including the infamous WannaCry ransomware, were due to a missing patch that was not applied on time. Apart from fixing vulnerabilities, patches play an important role in keeping systems stable, up-to-date, and safe from cyberattacks. It is essential to patch all operating systems and third-party applications continuously to safeguard your network from potential attacks. Deviation in security controls: Numerous security controls must be implemented in a device for adequate security. If these security controls are not configured properly, they might lead to security mishaps. For example, crucial security controls like antivirus and firewall should always be enabled. Any error in these settings or even if they are accidentally disabled, it serves as an alarming security loophole in an IT network. Like the above security risks, security deviations and posture anomalies are present in an IT infrastructure that are as alarming as a software vulnerability. Attack surface reduction cannot be achieved only by managing CVEs. All the vulnerabilities and security risks discussed above must be managed rigorously to minimize attack surfaces and combat cyberattacks. Again, opting for different solutions to manage all these vulnerabilities and security risks will only create chaos and complexities. IT security teams should start looking for a solution that automatically detects and remediates vulnerabilities, IT asset exposures, misconfigurations, security control deviations, and posture anomalies from a single place. Only a tool that treats all these vulnerabilities equally can meet today’s IT security demands and pave the way for a threat-free IT landscape. : News Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1082 System Information Discovery ,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter ,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation ,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job </s>"
"Microsoft appears to have silently fixed a two-year-old bug in in Windows Kernel Object Manager that could have allowed for the bypass of privileges in Google’s Chrome browser. Microsoft appears to have silently fixed a two-year-old bug in in Windows Kernel Object Manager that could have allowed for the bypass of privileges in Google’s Chrome browser. James Forshaw, a researcher with Google’s Project Zero first reported the issue in December 2014. Microsoft responded to Google a month later saying it didn’t consider the issue worthy of a fix. Forshaw and Google marked the issue as “WontFix” and removed the view restriction on the disclosure. It’s been more or less on ice since then. Microsoft’s stance changed at some point over the past 23 months however; Forshaw acknowledged in a post on the Project Zero Google Group early Wednesday morning that Microsoft has fixed the issue in a recent Windows 10 fix. It’s unclear whether Microsoft addressed the issue in a hotfix or via a silently issued patch but according to Forshaw, it has been reflected in the “latest few major builds of Windows 10 (10586+)” The issue, a limited bypass of traverse permissions, affected the Kernel Object Manager in Windows 7 (32/64 bit) and 8+. In 2014, Forshaw warned it could be possible for low privilege code to “access some device objects where it shouldn’t be possible [to] even determine they exist” in Chrome. Chrome’s sandbox token is fortified – its traverse permission is heavily enforced, according to Forshaw – but this issue slightly diminished that. Forshaw called the issue a “limitation” for Chrome when he originally highlighted the issue and admitted he didn’t expect it would ever become a “bulletin class issue, if it’s considered an issue at all.” If anything, he said it could result in a “minor security impact for Chrome.” Forshaw wrote Wednesday that he wasn’t sure what led Microsoft to fix the issue. Microsoft, for its part, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Forshaw couldn’t speak directly to the issue when reached on Wednesday but pointed Threatpost to an updated post he had made on the issue tracker: “For anyone who’s wondering if this is unusual for Microsoft that they fixed it so long after reporting, not really. If MSRC and by inference the product team do not consider the issue to meet their bar for a security bulletin (as mentioned in comment #2) then they’ll tend to not fix it in a patch. However they do leave themselves open to fixing it a later update of the platform, which for Win10 is becoming more frequent.” Forshaw adds that the fix may have been pushed inadvertently as other users of the function in question, SeCreateAccessState, may have been affected. “The trouble with this approach is there’s never any credit or notification for the fix and so I was under the impression that this issue still existed,” Forshaw said. : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1055 Process Injection,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion","<s>[INST] Microsoft appears to have silently fixed a two-year-old bug in in Windows Kernel Object Manager that could have allowed for the bypass of privileges in Google’s Chrome browser.

"QR codes have become a go-to staple for contactless transactions of all sorts during the pandemic, and the FBI is warning cybercriminals are capitalizing on their lax security to steal data and money, and drop malware. Menus, event ticket sales, quick site access — QR codes have become a common way to interact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the smart little matrix bar codes are easily tampered with and can be used to direct victims to malicious sites, the FBI warned in an alert. QR codes are the square, scannable codes familiar from applications like touchless menus at restaurants, and have gained in popularity over the pandemic as contactless interactions have become the norm. Simply navigating a smartphone camera over the image allows the device’s QR translator – built into most mobile phones – to “read” the code and open a corresponding website. “A victim scans what they think to be a legitimate code, but the tampered code directs victims to a malicious site, which prompts them to enter login and financial information,” the FBI alert explained. “Access to this victim information gives the cybercriminal the ability to potentially steal funds through victim accounts.” The FBI said it has also observed threat actors using malicious QR codes to download malware giving them access to a victim’s device, where they then accessed financial data to steal money. Cybercriminals are also swapping out genuine QR codes for their own, intercepting payments, collecting cash and data, the FBI added. QR Code Abuse Increases Last April, Ivanti conducted a survey which found 57 percent of consumers in an international sample increased QR code usage following the March 2020 pandemic onset. Worryingly, 87 percent of respondents told Ivanti they felt secure carrying out financial transactions following QR codes. The evidence suggests that user security confidence in QR codes is misplaced. Last summer the Better Business Bureau issued an alert that scammers were increasingly abusing QR codes in innovative ways; one elaborate scheme started with a malicious QR code and ended with sending victims to gas stations to use Bitcoin ATMs.. Purandar Das, co-founder and CEO at Sotero, said a rise in QR abuse was almost inevitable. “Every technological advance that is a legitimate opportunity to simplify user interaction is coopted by the criminals,” Das explained. “QR codes have become increasingly popular as a way to direct consumers to business website and applications. They have been become ubiquitous in the restaurant industry due to the pandemic and the desire to not have to pass around paper menus. There are just so many opportunities to trick consumers into providing information. The cat-and-mouse game continues.” FBI QR Code Tips The FBI offers several tips to avoid the next QR code scam: Double-check the URL of any site pulled up with a QR code to make sure it’s legitimate: “A malicious domain name may be similar to the intended URL but with typos or a misplaced letter,” the FBI added. Before engaging with a QR code, check to make sure the code itself hasn’t been tampered with. The FBI suggests looking for evidence a sticker has been slapped over the original code. The alert also cautions users against downloading an app from a QR code rather than the application store, which has more security protections. Do not download a QR code scanner app: The FBI said, “this increases your risk of downloading malware onto your device. Most phones have a built-in scanner through the camera app.” Don’t make payments to a site accessed by a QR code, if possible. And, if you receive a QR code that you believe to be from someone you know, reach out to the person through a known number or address to verify that the code is truly from them.

"Dell has patched two high-severity vulnerabilities in its SupportAssist software meant to aid security issues for customers. Two high-severity flaws in Dell’s client support tool, SupportAssist Client, could enable remote code-execution (RCE) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. SupportAssist helps users remove viruses or detect security issues on their PCs, and comes preinstalled on most new Dell devices. “Dell SupportAssist Client has been updated to address multiple vulnerabilities which may be potentially exploited to compromise the system,” according to Dell’s security advisory. Both flaws impact Dell SupportAssist Client versions prior to 3.2.0.90. The RCE flaw (CVE-2019-3719) has a CVSS score of 8, making it high-severity. An attacker could compromise the vulnerability by tricking a user into downloading and executing arbitrary executables through their SupportAssist client from attacker-hosted sites, Dell said. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the flaw – but they would need to share the network access layer with the vulnerable system. The researcher who discovered the flaw, 17-year-old Bill Demirkapi, published the proof of concept and a demo (below) of the attack on Tuesday. Essentially, an important integrity check exists in SupportAssist called ClientServiceHandler.ProcessRequest, which is where the server checks to make sure requests are actually from Dell. This allowed Demirkapi to “generate a random subdomain name and use an external machine to DNS [domain name server]-hijack the victim. Then, when the victim requests [random].dell.com, we respond with our server,” he said. That means that if a Dell system user goes to a malicious website, SupportAssist could be tricked into downloading malware-laced files and running them on the device. Demirkapi said he initially notified Dell of the flaw Oct. 26, 2018. The flaw was patched April 18, and the public disclosure of the PoC was released this past week. The second flaw is an improper origin validation vulnerability (CVE-2019-3718) with a ranking of 8.8, making it also a high-severity vulnerability. The bug, which was discovered by John C. Hennessy-ReCar, could be exploited by unauthenticated remote attacker who could launch CSRF attacks on users of the impacted systems. CSRF allows an attacker to send malicious commands from one site to another using the credentials of a user that the destination site trusts. Further details on the flaw were not made available. The computer-maker has had its fair share of security concerns, including last November, when the company warned its Dell.com customers of unauthorized activity on its network. Adversaries attempted to access names, email addresses and hashed passwords — which prompted a reset of all Dell.com customer passwords. : Mobile Security Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] Dell has patched two high-severity vulnerabilities in its SupportAssist software meant to aid security issues for customers.

"Forcepoint has fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability in its VPN Client for Windows. A vulnerability has been discovered in the Forcepoint VPN Client software for Windows. The flaw could enable an attacker – with an existing foothold on a system – to achieve an escalation of privilege, persistence and in some cases defense evasion. The vulnerability (CVE-2019-6145) stems from an un-patch issue in the Forcepoint VPN Client software. This software provides a secure virtual private network connection between end-user Windows computers and a Forcepoint’s VPN gateway. “This vulnerability could have been exploited by an attacker during a post-exploitation phase in order to achieve privilege escalation, persistence and in some cases defense evasion by using the technique of implanting an arbitrary unsigned executable which is executed by a signed service that runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM [the user account with the highest level of privileges],” researchers with SafeBreach said in a Friday analysis. The vulnerability exists in all versions below 6.6.1 of Forcepoint’s VPN Client for Windows. A fix, delivered in version 6.6.1 of the software, is available now, according to Forcepoint. The flaw manifests itself when the VPN client starts (which is usually during the Windows boot sequence). First, it incorrectly looks for and attempts to execute programs in two locations (“C:\\Program.exe” and “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Forcepoint\\VPN.exe”). Once it (incorrectly) discovers any file – even if unsigned – it would execute them as the most privileged user account (called NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM). So if an unauthorized user, with preexisting access to the system, planted an executable file in one of those two locations, the VPN Client would execute either, giving the user or attacker the highest level of privileges on the targeted end point. In a proof of concept test, researchers compiled an unsigned executable (EXE) file, which contained the name of the process that loaded it and the username that executed it to the filename of a txt file. The arbitrary unsigned EXE file was executed as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM by a legitimate process which is signed by Forcepoint. Hackers would need to jump through hoops to exploit the flaw. By default, only local administrators can write to the two locations (“C:\\Program.exe” and “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Forcepoint\\VPN.exe”), meaning that an attacker would need to be local and already have some administrator privileges. If an attacker were to exploit the vulnerability, they would have the ability to execute malicious payloads in a persistent way (each time the service is being loaded) as well as gain NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM access (the part of the VPN service that has the highest level of privileges and permissions) as an administrator. “The vulnerability gives attackers the ability to be executed by a signed service,” said researchers. “This ability might be abused by an attacker for different purposes such as execution and evasion, for example: Application Whitelisting Bypass.” The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 Base Score of 6.5, making it a medium-severity vulnerability. The vulnerability was first reported on Sept. 5, 2019; on Sept. 19 Forcepoint patched and disclosed the flaw.

If an attacker were to exploit the vulnerability, they would have the ability to execute malicious payloads in a persistent way (each time the service is being loaded) as well as gain NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM access (the part of the VPN service that has the highest level of privileges and permissions) as an administrator. “The vulnerability gives attackers the ability to be executed by a signed service,” said researchers. “This ability might be abused by an attacker for different purposes such as execution and evasion, for example: Application Whitelisting Bypass.” The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 Base Score of 6.5, making it a medium-severity vulnerability. The vulnerability was first reported on Sept. 5, 2019; on Sept. 19 Forcepoint patched and disclosed the flaw.

"The vulnerability, one of three patched by the company this week, could allow threat actors to breach the external perimeter of a data center or leverage backdoors already installed to take over a system. Click to Register VMware has patched three vulnerabilities in its virtual-machine infrastructure for data centers, the most serious of which is a remote code execution (RCE) flaw in its vCenter Server management platform. The vulnerability could allow attackers to breach the external perimeter of an enterprise data center or leverage backdoors already installed on a system to find other vulnerable points of network entry to take over affected systems. Positive Technologies researcher Mikhail Klyuchnikov discovered two of the flaws in vCenter Server, the centralized management and automation platform for VMware’s vSphere virtualization platform, which—given VMware’s dominant position in the market—is used by the majority of enterprise data centers. Among its duties, vCenter Server manages virtual machines, multiple ESXi hypervisor hosts and other various dependent components from a central management dashboard. Where the VMware Flaws Were Found, What’s Effected?  The researcher found the most critical of the flaws, which is being tracked as CVE-2021-21972 and has a CVSS v3 score of 9.8, in a vCenter Server plugin for vROPs in the vSphere Client functionality, according to an advisory posted online Tuesday by VMware. “A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server,” the company said. The plugin is available in all default installations—potentially giving attackers a wide attack surface–and vROPs need not be present to have this endpoint available, according to VMware. The main threat in terms of exploiting the vulnerability comes from insiders who have penetrated the protection of the network perimeter using other methods–such as social engineering or web vulnerabilities–or have access to the internal network using previously installed backdoors, according to Positive Technologies. Klyuchnikov said the VMware flaw poses “no less threat” than a notoriously easy-to-exploit Citrix RCE vulnerability, CVE-2019-19781, which was discovered two years ago affecting more than 25,000 servers globally. It is especially dangerous because “it can be used by any unauthorized user,” he said. “The error allows an unauthorized user to send a specially crafted request, which will later give them the opportunity to execute arbitrary commands on the server,” Klyuchnikov explained. “After receiving such an opportunity, the attacker can develop this attack, successfully move through the corporate network, and gain access to the data stored in the attacked system, such as information about virtual machines and system users.” How is CVE-2021-21972 Exploited? In the case in which vulnerable software can be accessed from the internet, an external attacker can break into a company’s external perimeter and also gain access to sensitive data, he added. This scenario is highly likely based on previous pentests executed by Positive Technologies, which allowed researchers to breach the network perimeter and gain access to local network resources in 93 percent of companies, according to the company. Another flaw patched by VMware in the update also has potential for remote code execution and affects the hypervisor VMware ESXi , the company said. CVE-2021-21974, with a CVSSv3 base score of 8.9. is a heap-overflow vulnerability in the OpenSLP component as used in an ESXi host. A threat actor who’s already inside the same network segment as an ESXi host and has access to port 427 can use the vulnerability to trigger the heap-overflow issue in the OpenSLP service, resulting in remote code execution, according to VMware. The other flaw Klyuchnikov discovered—tracked as CVE-2021-21973 and the least serious of the three–is a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to improper validation of URLs in a vCenter Server plugin with a CVSS score of 5.3, according to VMWare. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue by sending a POST request to vCenter Server plugin leading to information disclosure,” the company said. Unauthorized users can use the flaw to send requests as the targeted server to help threat actors develop further attacks. Used in combination with the other vulnerabilities, attackers could leverage it to scan the company’s internal network and obtain information about the open ports of various services, Klyuchnikov said. What VMware is Recommending for a Fix to the Data Center Bugs? VMware advised customers to install all updates provided to affected deployments to remediate the threat the vulnerabilities pose. The company also provided workarounds for those who can’t immediately update their systems. Positive Technologies also recommended that companies affected who have vCenter Server interfaces on the perimeter of their organizations remove them, and also allocate the interfaces to a separate VLAN with a limited access list in the internal network, the company said.

"Apple has issued a series of bulletins for its Safari browser fixing various security vulnerabilities in its WebKit rendering engine. Apple has updated its Safari browser, fixing a handful of exploitable WebKit flaws in various versions of Safari. WebKit is the core layout engine responsible for rendering webpages in the Safari browser. The first bulletin, vulnerabilities uncovered by Apple, resolves multiple memory corruption issues in Webkit. On unpatched systems, an attacker could exploit CVE-2015-1152, CVE-2015-1153 and CVE-2015-1154 by compelling a user to visit a malicious website, which, in turn, could lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution. Apple resolved the problem with improved memory handling. Fixes are available for OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.3. The second bulletin resolves just one vulnerability, CVE-2015-1155, which was discovered by Joe Vennix of Rapid7 along with researchers from HP’s Zero Day Initiative. The flaws emerged from a state management problem in Safari that allowed unprivileged origins to access filesystem contents. This was exploitable if a user were compelled to visit a specially created webpage, after which the attacker could access filesystem information. Apple resolved this in OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.3 through improved state management. The final bulletin, CVE-2015-1156, reported by Zachary Durber of Moodle, resolves a problem in the way that rel attributes are handled in anchor elements. Target objects could get unauthorized access to link objects, leading to interface spoofing, if an attacker compelled his victim to visit a maliciously crafted website. Apple fixed the problem by implementing better link-type adherence in  OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and OS X Yosemite v10.10.3.

"The discovery, which affects services running as localhost that aren’t exposed to any network or the internet, vastly widens the scope of attack possibilities. Defenders will once again be busy beavers this weekend: There’s an alternative attack vector for the ubiquitous Log4j vulnerability, which relies on a basic Javascript WebSocket connection to trigger remote code-execution (RCE) on servers locally, via drive-by compromise. In other words, an exploit can affect services running as localhost in internal systems that are not exposed to any network. That’s according to researchers at Blumira, who noted that the discovery eviscerates the notion that Log4Shell attacks are limited to exposed vulnerable web servers. “This newly discovered attack vector means that anyone with a vulnerable Log4j version can be exploited through the path of a listening server on their machine, or local network through browsing to a website, and triggering the vulnerability,” researchers said in a Friday note to Threatpost. Check out all of our Log4Shell coverage: Relentless Log4j Attacks Include State Actors, Possible Worm What the Log4Shell Bug Means for SMBs: Experts Weigh In How to Buy Precious Patching Time as Log4j Exploits Fly (Podcast) Apache’s Fix for Log4Shell Can Lead to DoS Attacks Where the Latest Log4Shell Attacks Are Coming From Log4Shell Is Spawning Even Nastier Mutations SAP Kicks Log4Shell Vulnerability Out of 20 Apps Zero Day in Ubiquitous Apache Log4j Tool Under Active Attack This means there are several new malicious use cases for an exploit, beyond the now-well-documented ability to open a shell with a single line of code to drop malware on internet-facing web servers. “[New use cases include everything] from malvertisting to creating watering holes for drive-by attacks,” said Matthew Warner, CTO and co-founder of Blumira, in a technical post. Using WebSockets for Malicious Gain WebSockets enables communication between a web browser and web applications, like chats and alerting on websites. They generally allow the browser to quickly send data back and forth to these types of apps, but they’re also used for host-fingerprinting and port-scanning. Warner explained in his posting that WebSockets is also fraught with security risk. “WebSockets are not restricted by same-origin policies like a normal cross-domain HTTP request,” he explained. “They expect the server itself to validate the origin of the request. While they are useful, they also introduce a fair amount of risk as they do not include many security controls to limit their utilization.” In the Log4j case, an attacker would make malicious requests via WebSockets to a potentially vulnerable localhost or local network server. The targets don’t have to be exposed to the internet. “WebSockets have previously been used for port-scanning internal systems, but this represents one of the first remote code execution exploits being relayed by WebSockets,” said Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at BreachQuest, via email. “This shouldn’t change anyone’s position on vulnerability management though. Organizations should be pushing to patch quickly and mitigate by preventing outbound connections from potentially vulnerable services where patching is not an option.” Local Attack Scenario for Log4Shell Warner offered a detailed breakdown of his proof-of-concept (PoC) for the attack in the posting; below is a truncated explanation. Step 1: From a watering-hole server with the affected Log4j2 vulnerability installed, an attacker would trigger a file path URL from the browser with a WebSocket connection. Blumira used a basic Javascript WebSocket connection in the PoC, but Warner noted that “this does not necessarily need to be localhost; WebSockets allow for connection to any IP and easily could iterate private IP space.” Step 2: As the page loads, it will initiate a local WebSocket connection, connect to the vulnerable listening server, and connect out over an identified type of connection based on a Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) connection string – a technique that’s similar to WebSockets’ localhost port-scanning used for fingerprinting hosts. Step 3: Once the victim’s host connects to an open port to a local service or a service accessible to the host itself, an attacker can then drop an exploit string in path or parameters. “When this happens, the vulnerable host calls out to the exploit server, loads the attacker’s class, and executes it with java.exe as the parent process,” according to Warner. Detection and Remediation The bad news is that this also a stealthy approach, according to the analysis: “WebSocket connections within the host can be difficult to gain deep visibility into, which increases the complexity of detection for this attack.” That’s because WebSocket connections silently initiate when a webpage loads, with no direct control by the client itself. However, Warner noted that there are ways to get around this. To detect a possible attack, Warner recommended looking for instances of “.*/java.exe” being used as the parent process for “cmd.exe/powershell.exe.” “This is potentially very noisy,” Warner said. And finally, organizations should also make sure they’re set up to detect the presence of Cobalt Strike, TrickBot and related common attacker tools. To identify where Log4j is used within local environments, there are publicly available scanning scripts, researchers noted, to identify the libraries used locally. Here are two: Windows PoSh – https://github.com/N-able/ScriptsAndAutomationPolicies/blob/master/Vulnerability%20-%20CVE-2021-44228%20(Log4j)/get-log4jrcevulnerability.ps1 Cross platform – https://github.com/hillu/local-log4j-vuln-scanner/releases To mitigate the risk completely, organizations should update all local development efforts, internal applications and internet-facing environments to Log4j 2.16 ASAP, including any custom applications. In the meantime, users can implement egress filtering, which can restrict the callback required for the actual exploit to land, and can use tools like NoScript Java-blocker on untrusted external sites to avoid Javascript triggering WebSocket connections. “This news does mean that relying on web application firewalls, or other network defenses, is no longer an effective mitigation,” John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said via email. “Patching remains the single most important step an organization can take.” Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls – unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.   : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1021 Remote Services,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] The discovery, which affects services running as localhost that aren’t exposed to any network or the internet, vastly widens the scope of attack possibilities.

"The out-of-band patches follow a lighter-than-usual Patch Tuesday update earlier this month. Adobe has released 18 out-of-band security patches in 10 different software packages, including fixes for critical vulnerabilities that stretch across its product suite. Adobe Illustrator was hit the hardest. There are 16 critical bugs, all of which allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. They affect Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe InDesign and the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application. Adobe also patched two important-rated issues, in Dreamweaver and the Marketo Sales Insight Salesforce package. Many of the issues concern uncontrolled search-path elements, but there are also out-of-bounds problems, memory-corruption issues and a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug. “Arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities are particularly nefarious given that they enable attackers to directly run malicious code on the exploited systems,” Jay Goodman, strategic product marketing manager at Automox, told Threatpost. “Coupled with the fact that these vulnerabilities are in critical technologies like Marketo and most of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications, this could leave sensitive marketing data and creative IP exposed to destruction or IP theft by potential adversaries. Organizations should move to quickly patch these vulnerabilities within the 72-hour window [we recommend] in order to minimize exposure and maintain a high level of cyber-hygiene.” Critical Patches Illustrator contains seven bugs affecting Illustrator 2020 for Windows, 24.2 and earlier versions. Two of the issues are out-of-bounds read flaws, (CVE-2020-24409, CVE-2020-24410); one is an out-of-bounds write bug (CVE-2020-24411). Tran Van Khang working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative is credited for the discoveries. “All of these vulnerabilities occur within the processing of PDF files by Illustrator,” Dustin Childs, communications manager for Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, told Threatpost. “In all three cases, an attacker can leverage the vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.” For the out-of-bounds read bugs, “Illustrator does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure,” he explained. Meanwhile, the out-of-bounds write bug “occurs because Illustrator does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure,” Childs said. Meanwhile, the other four Illustrator bugs are due to memory corruption (CVE-2020-24412, CVE-2020-24413,CVE-2020-24414, CVE-2020-24415), and Honggang Ren of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs was given the hat-tip for these. Ren is also credited with finding an out-of-bounds read problem (CVE-2020-24418) in After Effects for Windows (17.1.1 and? earlier versions). Meanwhile, Animate for Windows (20.5?and?earlier versions) contains a double-free bug (CVE-2020-9747); a stack-based buffer overflow issue (CVE-2020-9748); and two out-of-bounds reads (CVE-2020-9749 and CVE-2020-9750). Kexu Wang of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs is credited with finding the issues. Wang is also credited with finding a memory-corruption bug (CVE-2020-24421) afflicting InDesign for Windows (15.1.2 and earlier versions). Meanwhile, Hou JingYi of Qihoo 360 CERT found four critical uncontrolled search-path element bugs, including in: After Effects (CVE-2020-24419) Windows versions of Photoshop CC 2019, 20.0.10 and earlier versions; and Photoshop 2020, 21.2.2?and earlier?versions (both tracked as CVE-2020-24420) Premiere Pro for Windows, 14.4 and earlier versions (CVE-2020-24424) and Media Encoder for Windows, 14.4 and earlier versions (CVE-2020-24423) Users can update their software installations via the Creative Cloud desktop app updater, or by navigating to the application’s Help menu and clicking “Updates.” Speaking of Creative Cloud, the Creative Cloud Desktop Application?Installer?for Windows (5.2 and earlier versions for the older product and 2.1 and? earlier versions ?for the new installer) also has an uncontrolled search-path element bug (CVE-2020-24422) – this one uncovered by Dhiraj Mishra. Other Bugs Adobe Dreamweaver? 20.2 and earlier ?versions for Windows and macOS contains an uncontrolled search-path element bug that could allow privilege escalation (CVE-2020-24425). The flaw also affects libCURL dependencies in Dreamweaver ?20.1 and earlier. Xavier DANEST from Decathlon was credited with the discovery. And, the Marketo Sales Insight Salesforce package, 1.4355 and? earlier versions, has an XSS bug that allows JavaScript execution in the browser (CVE-2020-24416). It was discovered by Aditya Sharma and Shivam Kamboj Dattana of Root Fix. The out-of-band patches follow the disclosure of just one vulnerability in October as part of Adobe’s regularly scheduled patches (markedly less than the 18 flaws addressed during its September regular update). That was a critical bug in its Flash Player application for users on Windows, macOS, Linux and ChromeOS operating systems (CVE-2020-9746). If successfully exploited, it could lead to an exploitable crash, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user, according to Adobe. Also this month, Adobe announced two critical flaws (CVE-2020-24407 and CVE-2020-24400) in Magento – Adobe’s e-commerce platform that is commonly targeted by attackers like the Magecart threat group. ","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] The out-of-band patches follow a lighter-than-usual Patch Tuesday update earlier this month. Adobe has released 18 out-of-band security patches in 10 different software packages, including fixes for critical vulnerabilities that stretch across its product suite. Adobe Illustrator was hit the hardest. There are 16 critical bugs, all of which allow arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. They affect Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe InDesign and the Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop Application. Adobe also patched two important-rated issues, in Dreamweaver and the Marketo Sales Insight Salesforce package. Many of the issues concern uncontrolled search-path elements, but there are also out-of-bounds problems, memory-corruption issues and a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug. “Arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities are particularly nefarious given that they enable attackers to directly run malicious code on the exploited systems,” Jay Goodman, strategic product marketing manager at Automox, told Threatpost. “Coupled with the fact that these vulnerabilities are in critical technologies like Marketo and most of the Adobe Creative Cloud applications, this could leave sensitive marketing data and creative IP exposed to destruction or IP theft by potential adversaries. Organizations should move to quickly patch these vulnerabilities within the 72-hour window [we recommend] in order to minimize exposure and maintain a high level of cyber-hygiene.” Critical Patches Illustrator contains seven bugs affecting Illustrator 2020 for Windows, 24.2 and earlier versions. Two of the issues are out-of-bounds read flaws, (CVE-2020-24409, CVE-2020-24410); one is an out-of-bounds write bug (CVE-2020-24411). Tran Van Khang working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative is credited for the discoveries. “All of these vulnerabilities occur within the processing of PDF files by Illustrator,” Dustin Childs, communications manager for Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative, told Threatpost. “In all three cases, an attacker can leverage the vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.” For the out-of-bounds read bugs, “Illustrator does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure,” he explained. Meanwhile, the out-of-bounds write bug “occurs because Illustrator does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated structure,” Childs said. Meanwhile, the other four Illustrator bugs are due to memory corruption (CVE-2020-24412, CVE-2020-24413,CVE-2020-24414, CVE-2020-24415), and Honggang Ren of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs was given the hat-tip for these. Ren is also credited with finding an out-of-bounds read problem (CVE-2020-24418) in After Effects for Windows (17.1.1 and? earlier versions). Meanwhile, Animate for Windows (20.5?and?earlier versions) contains a double-free bug (CVE-2020-9747); a stack-based buffer overflow issue (CVE-2020-9748); and two out-of-bounds reads (CVE-2020-9749 and CVE-2020-9750). Kexu Wang of Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs is credited with finding the issues. Wang is also credited with finding a memory-corruption bug (CVE-2020-24421) afflicting InDesign for Windows (15.1.2 and earlier versions). Meanwhile, Hou JingYi of Qihoo 360 CERT found four critical uncontrolled search-path element bugs, including in: After Effects (CVE-2020-24419) Windows versions of Photoshop CC 2019, 20.0.10 and earlier versions; and Photoshop 2020, 21.2.2?and earlier?versions (both tracked as CVE-2020-24420) Premiere Pro for Windows, 14.4 and earlier versions (CVE-2020-24424) and Media Encoder for Windows, 14.4 and earlier versions (CVE-2020-24423) Users can update their software installations via the Creative Cloud desktop app updater, or by navigating to the application’s Help menu and clicking “Updates.” Speaking of Creative Cloud, the Creative Cloud Desktop Application?Installer?for Windows (5.2 and earlier versions for the older product and 2.1 and? earlier versions ?for the new installer) also has an uncontrolled search-path element bug (CVE-2020-24422) – this one uncovered by Dhiraj Mishra. Other Bugs Adobe Dreamweaver? 20.2 and earlier ?versions for Windows and macOS contains an uncontrolled search-path element bug that could allow privilege escalation (CVE-2020-24425). The flaw also affects libCURL dependencies in Dreamweaver ?20.1 and earlier. Xavier DANEST from Decathlon was credited with the discovery. And, the Marketo Sales Insight Salesforce package, 1.4355 and? earlier versions, has an XSS bug that allows JavaScript execution in the browser (CVE-2020-24416). It was discovered by Aditya Sharma and Shivam Kamboj Dattana of Root Fix. The out-of-band patches follow the disclosure of just one vulnerability in October as part of Adobe’s regularly scheduled patches (markedly less than the 18 flaws addressed during its September regular update). That was a critical bug in its Flash Player application for users on Windows, macOS, Linux and ChromeOS operating systems (CVE-2020-9746). If successfully exploited, it could lead to an exploitable crash, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user, according to Adobe.

"Mozilla fixed 32 vulnerabilities, including a critical bug that could have resulted in a crash, with the release Tuesday of Firefox 54, the latest version of its flagship browser. Mozilla fixed 32 vulnerabilities, including a critical bug that could have resulted in a crash, with the release Tuesday of Firefox 54, the latest version of its flagship browser. The critical bug, a use-after-free vulnerability, was dug up by longtime bug hunter Nils. The vulnerability (CVE-2017-5472) existed in the browser’s frameloader. Nils encountered the vulnerability during tree reconstruction while regenerating CSS layout. The researcher discovered that while attempting to access a node in the tree that didn’t exist, he could trigger a potentially exploitable crash. The update also resolved a dozen vulnerabilities considered high impact by Mozilla, including three additional use-after-free bugs; one during video control operations, one in content viewer, and one during docshell reloading. While all of the vulnerabilities also could’ve resulted in a crash of the browser, Mozilla deemed them less serious than CVE-2017-5472. Some of the vulnerabilities were specific to certain setups. One, CVE-2017-7759, could have allowed for the reading of local data by violating same origin policy – but only on Firefox for Android. Another vulnerability (CVE-2017-7755) could have allowed privilege escalation via the Firefox installer – but only on Windows operating systems. That bug, discovered by Yuji Tounai, a Tokyo-based researcher with NTT Communications, could have enabled Firefox’s installer to load malicious DLL files stored in the same directory as the installer. An additional, separate Windows-specific issue also affected the browser’s installer. That bug, discovered by security researcher Holger Fuhrmannek, could have allowed manipulation of files stored in the installer’s directory and in turn, like Tounai’s issue, allowed privilege escalation. Fuhrmannek has discovered a number of issues in Firefox, including another bug that could have allowed privilege escalation in Mozilla’s Maintenance Service updater, in Firefox 46 last year. Mozilla also fixed four different vulnerabilities on Tuesday that could have led to address bar spoofing. According to Mozilla’s advisory, one bug allowed Tibetan characters to be displayed as whitespace on OS X. Mozilla said another bug enabled characters from the “Canadian Syllabics” unicode block to be mixed with characters from other unicode blocks to carry out domain name spoofing attacks. None of the bugs were credited to Xudong Zheng, a Chinese researcher who brought to light in April a similar unicode bug that could have been used to carry out phishing attacks. Google fixed the vulnerability in Chrome 58 but Firefox developers said they were electing to stand pat on the issue. It appears Mozilla is in a holding pattern over Zheng’s vulnerability. At the time Firefox devs urged users to turn on Safe Browsing to protect them from phishing attacks. In addition to the bug fixes, Mozilla is boasting that Firefox 54 is the first to run multiple operating system processes for web page content, something that it claims speeds up performance. Multi-process support, a project Mozilla dubbed Electrolysis, has been in development for years.

"Cisco routers are built into the fabric of the Internet and enterprise networks, a fact that makes them highly attractive targets for attackers. Researchers at FireEye have come across attacks recently in which hackers have been modifying the firmware of Cisco routers and using that foothold to maintain persistence on the victim’s network. Such a technique would give an attacker an excellent position from which to surveil the victim’s network and potentially move to different machines, as well. The FireEye researchers say that the attackers are using a modified IOS image and typically are not exploiting any new vulnerabilities in order to compromise routers. Instead, they probably are taking advantage of either default or stolen credentials in order to gain initial access to the routers. “The implant consists of a modified Cisco IOS image that allows the attacker to load different functional modules from the anonymity of the internet. The implant also provides unrestricted access using a secret backdoor password. Each of the modules are enabled via the HTTP protocol (not HTTPS), using a specifically crafted TCP packets sent to the routers interface,” an analysis of the technique by Bill Hau and Tony Lee of FireEye says. “The packets have a nonstandard sequence and corresponding acknowledgment numbers.  The modules can manifest themselves as independent executable code or hooks within the routers IOS that provide functionality similar to the backdoor password. The backdoor password provides access to the router through the console and Telnet.” The researchers say that Cisco 1841, 2811, and 3825 routers are known to be targeted in this kind of attack. The modified IOS image that the attackers are using in these attacks survives a reboot of the router, but additional modules the attackers load live in volatile memory and will be lost after a reboot. The malicious implant modifies a function to point to the malware and overwrites a few other functions, as well. Once the malicious IOS image is on the router, the attackers are using a modular command-and-control system to maintain communication. “The CnC functionality is stealthy because it requires a series of TCP trigger packets that the malware monitors for specific TCP header values and content. Even if filters are enabled on the router, the TCP trigger is processed by the malware. The malware will respond to trigger packets sent three different addresses: the router interface, the broadcast IP, and the network address (the first IP in a subnet),” the FireEye analysis says. The attacks detailed by FireEye are similar to ones Cisco warned customers about last month. In those attacks, hackers are again using valid credentials to connect to IOS devices and then upload malicious ROM Monitor images. “In all cases seen by Cisco, attackers accessed the devices using valid administrative credentials and then used the ROMMON field upgrade process to install a malicious ROMMON. Once the malicious ROMMON was installed and the IOS device was rebooted, the attacker was able to manipulate device behavior. Utilizing a malicious ROMMON provides attackers an additional advantage because infection will persist through a reboot,” Cisco said in an advisory in August. : Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1021 Remote Services,T1055 Process Injection,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Cisco routers are built into the fabric of the Internet and enterprise networks, a fact that makes them highly attractive targets for attackers.

"Web analytics firm plugs a hole in its platform that allowed attackers to open a reverse shell that could be used to attack the service. UPDATE Search engine optimization and analytics firm SEMrush patched a remote code execution vulnerability that allowed an attacker to send a malicious image to its service and generate a reverse shell, a typical first stage in a cyberattack. Public disclosure of the vulnerability was Monday when details of the bug were shared by a white hat hacker who boasted he had earned a bounty of $10,000 for the discovery. The RCE bug was tied to SEMrush’s Report Builder feature that allows users to generate custom web analytics reports using their own branding. The problem was how SEMrush handled logo images uploaded to the platform and the use of an unpatched version of ImageMagick, a web service used to process images. SEMrush said the impact was limited to an isolated portion of its main platform. “This bug affected a specific microservice responsible for generating reports,” a company spokesperson said. “The attacker, even in the event of a successful attack on the server, under no circumstances can access the entire platform.” According to Frans Rosén who is credited with finding the bug via the HackerOne bug bounty platform: “The Logo upload in the report constructor is passed through a not properly patched version of ImageMagick. You can use Postscript to get Ghostscript to run which in return allows to trigger arbitrary commands on the server, leading to Remote Code Execution.” SEMrush said the window of vulnerability was only a few days. “We would also like to mention that our platform is WAF (Web Application Firewall) secured which proactively protects our platform from attacks but a few days before report we turned it to monitoring mode to mitigate some false positive alert, that was why Frans Rosén got the opportunity to successfully exploit the issue,” the company said. While public disclosure of the bug was Monday, SEMrush said the bug was originally reported in August of 2018 and fixed within an hour of it being reported. It said there is no evidence the vulnerability was ever exploited by a malicious actor. The researcher tied the ImageMagick vulnerability to a second Ghostscript flaw that could allow attackers to take remote control of systems. Ghostscript is a widely used interpreter for Adobe PostScript and PDF page description languages. Last year, Tavis Ormandy, a vulnerability researcher at Google’s Project Zero security team, discovered a Ghostscript bug and that it could allow attackers to remotely take control of a vulnerable system. “Ghostscript contains an optional -dSAFER option, which is supposed to prevent unsafe PostScript operations. Multiple PostScript operations bypass the protections provided by -dSAFER, which can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with arbitrary arguments,” wrote the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team. “This vulnerability can also be exploited in applications that leverage Ghostscript, such as ImageMagick, GraphicsMagick, evince, Okular, Nautilus, and others.” Fixes for Ghostscript were deployed in August 2018. Researcher Rosén did not return a request for comment. Mitigation advice from the researcher at the time to SEMrush was to “urgently make sure your policy.xml for imagemagick ONLY allows gif, jpg, png and nothing else.” (This story was updated on 8 a.m. EDT 2/24 with a comment from SEMrush) : Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Web analytics firm plugs a hole in its platform that allowed attackers to open a reverse shell that could be used to attack the service.

"These code bombs lurk in the PyPI package repository, waiting to be inadvertently baked into software developers\u2019 applications. A group of cryptominers was found to have infiltrated the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of software code created in the Python programming language. Similar to other repositories like GitHub, npm and RubyGems, PyPI is part of the software supply chain. It offers a place where coders can upload software packages for use by developers in building various applications, services and other projects. Unfortunately, a single malicious package can be baked into multiple different projects \u2013 infecting them with cryptominers, info-stealers and more, and making remediation a complex process. Researchers at Sonatype found six different malicious packages hiding in PyPI, which have a collective 5,000 downloads, all uploaded by a user with the handle \u201cnedog123,\u201d according to a Tuesday blog post. These consist of a main package called \u201cmaratlib,\u201d along with five others that use maratlib as a component: maratlib1; matplatlib-plus; mllearnlib; mplatlib and learninglib. \u201cAlso, some of these packages are typosquats, or programs that are expected to be grabbed by people accidentally typing in the wrong name,\u201d wrote Sontaype researcher Ax Sharma in the posting. \u201cFor example, the counterfeit mplatlib and matplatlib-plus are named after the legitimate Python plotting software [called] matplotlib.\u201d The maratlib Malicious Python Package In all of the packages, the malicious code is contained in a build script that runs during a package\u2019s installation, dubbed \u201csetup.py.\u201d This file downloads and runs a Bash script from GitHub. The Bash scripts run cryptominers on compromised machines, including one dubbed \u201cUbqminer,\u201d and the open-source cryptomining program known as T-Rex. The former mines for UBIQ coins, while the latter uses NVIDIA GPU processors to mine for Ethereum. \u201cOnce again, this particular discovery is a further indication that developers are the new target for adversaries over the software they write,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThese PyPI packages have been lurking on the repository for months, targeting developer systems with the goal of turning them into cryptominers.\u201d Sonatype said that it notified PyPI of the packages, which, according to a site search by Threatpost, appear to have been taken down. It\u2019s unclear how many active projects contain the malicious code, however, so the threat persists. \u201cThis is a systemic threat, and it needs to be actively addressed on several layers, both by the maintainers of software repositories and by the developers,\u201d explained Ilya Khivrich, chief scientist with Vdoo, via email. \u201cOn the developers\u2019 side, preventive measures such as verification of library signatures and employing automated tools to scan for hints of suspicious code included in the project should be included in the CI/CD pipeline.\u201d The threat actor could crop up again using aliases, of course. In examining the URLs serving the scripts, Sharma kept receiving 404 (not found) errors, but eventually discovered an updated alias for the original \u201cnedog123\u201d user: \u201cmaratoff.\u201d \u201cThe commit IDs associated with update/deletion of these scripts found on GitHub mirrors that mentioned alias nedog123, matched the commits in maratoff\u2019s repository,\u201d he explained. \u201cAlso, the newer maratoff repo contains files referencing the deleted nedog123 alias.\u201d Developers: The New Supply-Chain Target for Malware As Sharma pointed out, this latest discovery is part of a growing trend of malware infesting software repositories as part of next-gen supply-chain attacks, including recent copycat packages targeting well-known tech companies.

A group of cryptominers was found to have infiltrated the Python Package Index (PyPI), which is a repository of software code created in the Python programming language. Similar to other repositories like GitHub, npm and RubyGems, PyPI is part of the software supply chain. It offers a place where coders can upload software packages for use by developers in building various applications, services and other projects. Unfortunately, a single malicious package can be baked into multiple different projects \u2013 infecting them with cryptominers, info-stealers and more, and making remediation a complex process. Researchers at Sonatype found six different malicious packages hiding in PyPI, which have a collective 5,000 downloads, all uploaded by a user with the handle \u201cnedog123,\u201d according to a Tuesday blog post. These consist of a main package called \u201cmaratlib,\u201d along with five others that use maratlib as a component: maratlib1; matplatlib-plus; mllearnlib; mplatlib and learninglib. \u201cAlso, some of these packages are typosquats, or programs that are expected to be grabbed by people accidentally typing in the wrong name,\u201d wrote Sontaype researcher Ax Sharma in the posting. \u201cFor example, the counterfeit mplatlib and matplatlib-plus are named after the legitimate Python plotting software [called] matplotlib.\u201d The maratlib Malicious Python Package In all of the packages, the malicious code is contained in a build script that runs during a package\u2019s installation, dubbed \u201csetup.py.\u201d This file downloads and runs a Bash script from GitHub. The Bash scripts run cryptominers on compromised machines, including one dubbed \u201cUbqminer,\u201d and the open-source cryptomining program known as T-Rex. The former mines for UBIQ coins, while the latter uses NVIDIA GPU processors to mine for Ethereum. \u201cOnce again, this particular discovery is a further indication that developers are the new target for adversaries over the software they write,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThese PyPI packages have been lurking on the repository for months, targeting developer systems with the goal of turning them into cryptominers.\u201d Sonatype said that it notified PyPI of the packages, which, according to a site search by Threatpost, appear to have been taken down. It\u2019s unclear how many active projects contain the malicious code, however, so the threat persists. \u201cThis is a systemic threat, and it needs to be actively addressed on several layers, both by the maintainers of software repositories and by the developers,\u201d explained Ilya Khivrich, chief scientist with Vdoo, via email. \u201cOn the developers\u2019 side, preventive measures such as verification of library signatures and employing automated tools to scan for hints of suspicious code included in the project should be included in the CI/CD pipeline.\u201d The threat actor could crop up again using aliases, of course. In examining the URLs serving the scripts, Sharma kept receiving 404 (not found) errors, but eventually discovered an updated alias for the original \u201cnedog123\u201d user: \u201cmaratoff.\u201d \u201cThe commit IDs associated with update/deletion of these scripts found on GitHub mirrors that mentioned alias nedog123, matched the commits in maratoff\u2019s repository,\u201d he explained. \u201cAlso, the newer maratoff repo contains files referencing the deleted nedog123 alias.\u201d Developers: The New Supply-Chain Target for Malware As Sharma pointed out, this latest discovery is part of a growing trend of malware infesting software repositories as part of next-gen supply-chain attacks, including recent copycat packages targeting well-known tech companies.

"Two vulnerabilities were discovered on Dongguan Diqee-branded vacuum cleaners, Thursday. UPDATE Researchers have uncovered vulnerabilities in a connected vacuum cleaner lineup that could allow attackers to eavesdrop, perform video surveillance and steal private data from victims. Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Dongguan Diqee 360 vacuum cleaners, which tout Wi-Fi capabilities, a webcam with night vision, and smartphone-controlled navigation controls. These would allow control over the device as well as the ability to  intercept data on a home Wi-Fi network. “Like any other IoT device, these robot vacuum cleaners could be marshaled into a botnet for DDoS attacks, but that’s not even the worst-case scenario, at least for owners,” Leigh-Anne Galloway, cybersecurity resilience lead at Positive Technologies, said on Thursday. The first bug (CVE-2018-10987) is a remote code execution issue that resides in the REQUEST_SET_WIFIPASSWD function (UDP command 153) of the vacuum. “This vulnerability allows attackers to obtain superuser rights on the vacuum, meaning they can control it remotely, viewing video and images, and physically moving the vacuum,” Galloway told Threatpost. “It can also be used in a botnet for DDoS attacks or for bitcoin mining.” An attacker can discover the vacuum on the network by obtaining its media access control (MAC) address – an unique identifier assigned for communications at the data link layer of a network. They can then send a specially-crafted user datagram communications protocol (UDP) request, which results in execution of a command with superuser rights on the vacuum.  A crafted UDP packet runs “/mnt/skyeye/mode_switch.sh %s” with an attacker controlling the %s variable. “To succeed, the attacker must authenticate on the device—which is made easier by the fact that many affected devices have the default username and password combination (admin:888888),” researchers said. A second vulnerability (CVE-2018-10988) would also allow superuser rights, but additionally, could enable crooks to steal unencrypted data, including photos, video and emails, sent from other devices on the same Wi-Fi network. The bug exists in the vacuum’s update mechanism – and it is less threatening as it requires attackers to have physical access to the vacuum. Attackers exploiting this bug could create a special script and place it on a microSD card, then insert it into the vacuum. After the card is inserted, the vacuum update system runs firmware files from the upgrade_360 folder with superuser rights, without any digital signature check. The script could run arbitrary code, such as a sniffer, to intercept private data sent over Wi-Fi by other devices. Positive Technologies told Threatpost it followed responsible disclosure practices, alerting the company on March 15, 2018. Positive Technologies also submitted the vulnerabilities officially (CVE-2018-10987 and CVE-2018-10987). “Positive Technologies does not have any information about whether or not the vulnerabilities have been fixed to date,” the company told Threatpost. A spokesperson with Chinese supplier Dongguan Diqee did not specify whether a patch was issued, but said end users should change their default usernames and passwords. “[It’s a] default username and password problem, users can bind the device once they receive it and modify the password immediately after binding [is] completed and prevent others from listening with the default username and password,” the spokesperson said. “After modification, the default username and password are not effective.” A similar incident occurred last year, when researchers discovered that LG’s Hom-Bot IoT vacuum cleaner lineup was open to a hack that would let an attacker take control of the devices and their cameras –and give them the ability to live-stream video from inside a home. These  vulnerabilities may also affect other IoT devices using the same video modules as Dongguan Diqee 360 vacuum cleaners. Such devices include outdoor surveillance cameras, DVRs, and smart doorbells, researchers said. “New IoT devices are being created and deployed every day,” Galloway told Threatpost. “If these issues continue to go addressed, IoT security will progressively get worse. To address security issues, the industry should create a comprehensive, agreed-upon set of guidelines in cooperation with all parties, from hardware manufacturers to service providers and security experts.” This post was updated Friday July 20 at 10 a.m. with a statement from Dongguan Diqee.   : Editor's Picks IoT Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1018 Remote System Discovery","<s>[INST] Two vulnerabilities were discovered on Dongguan Diqee-branded vacuum cleaners, Thursday.

"Apache recently patched denial of service and information disclosure vulnerabilities in its Tomcat web server. Apache recently patched Tomcat, fixing a trio of information disclosure bugs and a denial of service bug in the open source web server and servlet container. The denial of service bug, discovered in February by David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team, could have allowed an attacker to create a malformed chunk size as part of a chunked request that would’ve allowed an unlimited amount of data to be streamed to the server. This would have bypassed the size limits enforced on a request and triggered a denial of service condition. The information disclosure bugs – all discovered by Tomcat’s security team – could have basically allowed an attacker to bypass limits set by the software. The first one (CVE-2014-0096) could’ve let a malicious web app bypass the file access constraints set by the security manager by using external XML entries. The second (CVE-2014-0119) could’ve allowed the same thing, the bypass of limits set on XML external identities, but also allowed the visibility of the XML files processed for other web apps deployed on the same Tomcat instance. The last information disclosure bug (CVE-2014-0099) dealt with a problem in the way the code used to parse the request content length header. It didn’t check for overflow when all was said and done. This led to a request smuggling vulnerability when the web server was behind a reverse proxy that correctly processed the content length header. Request smuggling vulnerabilities, when submitted data is incompletely parsed through a HTTP system as a proxy, can be tricky and lead to a handful of other attacks like cache poisoning, session hijacking and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The information disclosure bugs, while discovered in February, March and April, were not made public until Tuesday, along with the denial of service issue. Users of vulnerable versions, 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3, 7.0.0 to 7.0.52, and 6.0.0 to 6.0.39, are being encouraged to update to the most recent builds to mitigate the bugs. : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] Apache recently patched denial of service and information disclosure vulnerabilities in its Tomcat web server.

"The Skeleton Key malware bypasses single-factor authentication on Active Directory domain controllers and paves the way to stealthy cyberespionage. Enterprise Active Directory administrators need to be on the lookout for anomalous privileged user activity after the discovery of malware capable of bypassing single-factor authentication on AD that was used as part of a larger cyberespionage campaign against a global company based in London. Hackers already on the company’s network via a remote access Trojan (RAT) deployed what’s being called the Skeleton Key malware used to steal legitimate insider credentials in order to steal company data and exfiltrate it to the outside without raising many red flags. Researchers at Dell SecureWorks would not identify the organization, nor provide any indication on the identity or location of the attackers, other than to say that it was not an “ecrime” operation and some of the documents taken would be of interest to entities on the “Pacific rim.” Skeleton Key purposely lacks persistence, said Dell SecureWorks director of technology Don Smith. It is installed as an in-memory patch on an Active Directory domain controller and will not survive a reboot. Granted, Active Directory domain controllers such as the ones compromised in this attack, are not rebooted all that often. “I don’t think it was a mistake [by the attackers]. The people concerned have the capability of making it persistent,” Smith said. “The lack of persistence characterizes the stealthy nature of this operation. If you make it persistent over a reboot, you have to leave something behind in the registry or elsewhere that will make it restart. This is super stealthy and this minimizes their footprint. They rely on their foothold elsewhere in the network, and jump in every time they need to.” With access to Active Directory, the hackers can secure username-password combinations and use those credentials to remotely carry out the rest of their attack authenticated as legitimate users. In the case of the London firm, they were discovered on the network which used password-only authentication for its webmail and VPN remote access. Once inside, they were able to use credentials stolen from critical servers, admin workstations and domain controllers to drop Skeleton Key anywhere else on the network. Dell SecureWorks posted a number of indicators of compromise and YARA detection signatures in a report published this week. A number of file names were also found associated with Skeleton Key, including one suggesting an older variant of the malware exists, one that was compiled in 2012. Dell SecureWorks also said the attackers, once on the network, upload the malware’s DLL file to an already compromised machine and attempt to access admin shares on the domain controllers using a list of stolen admin credentials. If the credentials don’t work, they deploy password-stealing tools to extract admin passwords from memory of another server, the domain admin’s workstation or the targeted domain controllers, Dell SecureWorks said. With access to the controller, Skeleton Key’s DLL is loaded and the attackers use the PsExec utility to remotely inject the Skeleton Key patch and run the malware’s DLL remotely on the target domain controllers. The attackers then use a NTLM password hash to authenticate as any user. Skeleton Key purposely lacks persistence; it is installed as an in-memory patch on an Active Directory domain controller Tweet The lack of persistence isn’t the only perceived weakness associated with Skeleton Key. Its deployment caused AD domain controller replication issues in regional offices that required a reboot. The frequent reboots were an indication that the attackers were re-implanting Skeleton Key, Smith said, which along with the presence of PsExec or TaskScheduler are other anomalous privileged user activities to be on the lookout for. “This was from about just collecting passwords. Once they injected the hash, they could then walk up to any machine in the network, give any user name and their password and get in,” Smith said. “The bad guys used remote access to authenticate at will. I think that characterizes this attack as a long-running cyberespionage operation. There is a lot of information in the victim organization they’re looking for, and they want to maintain as low a profile as possible to evade discovery.

"These statistics are based on detection verdicts for Kaspersky products received from users who consented to providing statistical data.According to Kaspersky Security Network,Q1 2020 will be remembered primarily for the coronavirus pandemic and cybercriminals’ exploitation of the topic. In particular, the creators of a new modification of the Ginp banking trojan renamed their malware Coronavirus Finder and then began offering it for €0.75 disguised as an app supposedly capable of detecting nearby people infected with COVID-19. Thus, the cybercriminals tried not only to scam users by exploiting hot topics, but to gain access to their bank card details. And, because the trojan remains on the device after stealing this data, the cybercriminals could intercept text messages containing two-factor authorization codes and use the stolen data without the victim’s knowledge.Another interesting find this quarter was Cookiethief, a trojan designed to steal cookies from mobile browsers and the Facebook app. In the event of a successful attack, the malware provided its handler with access to the victim’s account, including the ability to perform various actions in their name, such as liking, reposting, etc. To prevent the service from spotting any abnormal activity in the hijacked profile, the trojan contains a proxy module through which the attackers issue commands.The third piece of malware that caught our attention this reporting quarter was trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Shopper.a. It is designed to help cybercriminals to leave fake reviews and drive up ratings on Google Play. The attackers’ goals here are obvious: to increase the changes of their apps getting published and recommended, and to lull the vigilance of potential victims. Note that to rate apps and write reviews, the trojan uses Accessibility Services to gain full control over the other app: in this case, the official Google Play client.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky’s mobile products and technologies detected 1,152,662 malicious installation packages, or 171,669 more than in the previous quarter.Number of malicious installation packages detected, Q1 2019 – Q1 2020 (download)Starting in Q2 2019, we have seen a steady rise in the number of mobile threats detected. Although it is too early to sound the alarm (2019 saw the lowest number of new threats in recent years), the trend is concerning.Distribution of newly detected mobile programs by type, Q1 2020 and Q4 2019 (download)Of all the threats detected in Q1, half were unwanted adware apps (49.9%), their share having increased by 19 p.p. compared to the previous quarter. Most often, we detected members of the HiddenAd and Ewind families, with a combined slice of 40% of all detected adware threats, as well as the FakeAdBlocker family (12%).Potentially unwanted RiskTool apps (28.24%) took second place; the share of this type of threat remained almost unchanged. The Smsreg (49% of all detected threats of this class), Agent (17%) and Dnotua (11%) families were the biggest contributors. Note that in Q1, the number of detected members of the Smsreg family increased by more than 50 percent.In third place were Trojan-Dropper-type threats (9.72%). Although their share decreased by 7.63 p.p. against the previous quarter, droppers remain one of the most common classes of mobile threats. Ingopack emerged as Q1’s leading family with a massive 71% of all Trojan-Dropper threats, followed by Waponor (12%) and Hqwar (8%) far behind.It is worth noting that mobile droppers are most often used for installing financial malware, although some financial threats can spread without their help. The share of these self-sufficient threats is quite substantial: in particular, the share of Trojan-Banker in Q1 increased by 2.1 p.p. to 3.65%.Note that this malware rankings do not include potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products that were attacked.First place in our Top 20 as ever went to DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (44.89%), the verdict we use for malware detected using cloud technology. They are triggered when the antivirus databases still lack the data for detecting a malicious program, but the Kaspersky Security Network cloud already contains information about the object. This is basically how the latest malware is detected.Second and third places were claimed by Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (9.09%) and DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML (7,08%) respectively.

Eighth-placed Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Necro.z (2.30%) acts in a similar way, extracting from itself only those modules that it needs.

As soon as it runs, the malware hides its icon on the list of apps and continues to operate in the background. The trojan’s payload can be other trojan programs or adware apps.Sixth place went to Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a (2.45%), which is what Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro usually delivers. Helper.a is tasked with downloading arbitrary code from the cybercriminals’ server and running it.The verdict Trojan.AndroidOS.Handda.san (2.31%) in seventh place is a group of diverse trojans that hide their icons, gain Device Admin rights on the device, and use packers to evade detection.Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy.e (1.43%) and Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Penguin.e (1.42%) warrant a special mention. The former is the only banking trojan in the top 20 this past quarter. The Rotexy family is all of six years old, and its members have the functionality to steal bank card details and intercept two-factor payment authorization messages. In turn, the first member of the Penguin dropper family was only detected last July and had gained significant popularity by Q1 2020.

The adware trojan Shlayer.a (19.27%) still tops the leaderboard, followed by objects that Shlayer itself loads into the infected system, in particular, numerous adware apps from the Pirrit family.Interestingly, the unwanted program Hoax.OSX.SuperClean.gen landed in 12th place on the list. Like other Hoax-type programs, it is distributed under the guise of a system cleanup app, and immediately after installation, scares the user with problems purportedly found in the system, such as gigabytes of trash on the hard drive.* Excluded from the rankings are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS (under 5,000) ** Unique users who encountered macOS threats as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky security solutions for macOS in the country.The leading countries, as in previous quarters, were Spain (7.14%), France (6.94%) and Italy (5.94%).

Threats from the Mirai family traditionally dominated: its members claimed four places in our top 10. These malicious programs will continue to rule the world of IoT threats for a long time to come, at least until the appearance of a more advanced (and publicly available) DDoS bot.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions blocked attempts to launch one or several types of malware designed to steal money from bank accounts on the computers of 249,748 users.Number of unique users attacked by financial malware, Q1 2020 (download)Attack geographyTo assess and compare the risk of being infected by banking trojans and ATM/POS malware in various countries, for each country we calculated the share of users of Kaspersky products that faced this threat during the reporting period out of all users of our products in that country.Geography of banking malware attacks, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries by share of attacked users* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky product users (under 10,000). ** Unique users whose computers were targeted by financial malware as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Top 10 banking malware families** Unique users attacked by this malware family as a percentage of all users attacked by financial malware.Ransomware attacks on organizations, as well as on city and municipal networks, did not ease off. Given how lucrative they are for cybercriminals, there is no reason why this trend of several years should cease.More and more ransomware is starting to supplement encryption with data theft. To date, this tactic has been adopted by distributors of ransomware families, including Maze, REvil/Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer and JSWorm/Nemty/Nefilim. If the victim refuses to pay the ransom for decryption (because, say, the data was recovered from a backup copy), the attackers threaten to put the stolen confidential information in the public domain. Such threats are sometimes empty, but not always: the authors of several ransomware programs have set up websites that do indeed publish the data of victim organizations.In Q1 2020, we detected five new ransomware families and 5,225 new modifications of these malware programs.Number of new ransomware modifications detected, Q1 2019 – Q1 2020 (download)In Q1 2020, Kaspersky products and technologies protected 178,922 users from ransomware attacks.Number of unique users attacked by ransomware trojans, Q1 2020 (download) Geography of attacks by ransomware trojans, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries attacked by ransomware trojans* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 50,000). ** Unique users whose computers were attacked by ransomware trojans as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Trojan-Ransom.Win32.PolyRansom* Unique Kaspersky users attacked by the specified family of ransomware trojans as a percentage of all users attacked by ransomware trojans.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions detected 192,036 new miner modifications.Number of new miner modifications, Q1 2020 (download)In Q1, we detected attacks using miners on the computers of 518,857 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products worldwide.Number of unique users attacked by miners, Q1 2020 (download) Geography of miner attacks, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries attacked by miners* Excluded are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky products (under 50,000). ** Unique users whose computers were attacked by miners as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.We already noted that Microsoft Office vulnerabilities are the most common ones. Q1 2020 was no exception: the share of exploits for these vulnerabilities grew to 74.83%. The most popular vulnerability in Microsoft Office was CVE-2017-11882, which is related to a stack overflow error in the Equation Editor component. Hard on its heels was CVE-2017-8570, which is used to embed a malicious script in an OLE object inside an Office document. Several other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2017-8759, were also popular with attackers. In the absence of security updates for Microsoft Office, these vulnerabilities are successfully exploited and the user’s system becomes infected.In second place were exploits for vulnerabilities in Internet browsers (11.06%). In Q1, cybercriminals attacked a whole host of browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. What’s more, some of the vulnerabilities were used in APT attacks, such as CVE-2020-0674, which is associated with the incorrect handling of objects in memory in an outdated version of the JScript scripting engine in Internet Explorer, leading to code execution. Another example is the previously identified CVE-2019-17026, a data type mismatch vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox’s JIT compiler, which also leads to remote code execution. In the event of a successful attack, both browser exploits cause a malware infection. The researchers also detected a targeted attack against Google Chrome exploiting the RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-6418 in the JavaScript engine; in addition, the dangerous RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-0767 was detected in a component of the ChakraCore scripting engine used by Microsoft Edge. Although modern browsers have their own protection mechanisms, cybercriminals are forever finding ways around them, very often using chains of exploits to do so. Therefore, it is vital to keep the operating system and software up to date at all times.Distribution of exploits used in attacks by type of application attacked, Q1 2020 (download)This quarter, a wide range of critical vulnerabilities were detected in operating systems and their components.Various network attacks on system services and network protocols were as popular as ever with attackers. We continue to detect attempts at exploiting vulnerabilities in the SMB protocol using EternalBlue, EternalRomance and similar sets of exploits. In Q1 2020, the new vulnerability CVE-2020-0796 (SMBGhost) was detected in the SMBv3 network protocol, leading to remote code execution, in which regard the attacker does not even need to know the username/password combination (since the error occurs before the authentication stage); however, it is present only in Windows 10. In Remote Desktop Gateway there were found two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610) enabling an unauthorized user to execute remote code in the target system. In addition, there were more frequent attempts to brute-force passwords to Remote Desktop Services and Microsoft SQL Server via the SMB protocol as well.The statistics in this section are based on Web Anti-Virus, which protects users when malicious objects are downloaded from malicious/infected web pages. Malicious websites are specially created by cybercriminals; web resources with user-created content (for example, forums), as well as hacked legitimate resources, can be infected.The following statistics show the distribution by country of the sources of Internet attacks blocked by Kaspersky products on user computers (web pages with redirects to exploits, sites containing exploits and other malicious programs, botnet C&C centers, etc.). Any unique host could be the source of one or more web-based attacks.To determine the geographical source of web-based attacks, domain names are matched against their actual domain IP addresses, and then the geographical location of a specific IP address (GEOIP) is established.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions defeated 726,536,269 attacks launched from online resources located in 203 countries worldwide. As many as 442,039,230 unique URLs were recognized as malicious by Web Anti-Virus components.Distribution of web-based attack sources by country, Q1 2020 (download)To assess the risk of online infection faced by users in different countries, for each country, we calculated the percentage of Kaspersky users on whose computers Web Anti-Virus was triggered during the quarter. The resulting data provides an indication of the aggressiveness of the environment in which computers operate in different countries.This rating only includes attacks by malicious programs that fall under the Malware class; it does not include Web Anti-Virus detections of potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 10,000). ** Unique users targeted by Malware-class attacks as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.These statistics are based on detection verdicts returned by the Web Anti-Virus module that were received from users of Kaspersky products who consented to providing statistical data.On average, 6.56% of Internet user’ computers worldwide experienced at least one Malware-class attack.Geography of malicious web-based attacks, Q1 2020 (download)In this section, we analyze statistical data obtained from the OAS and ODS modules in Kaspersky products. It takes into account malicious programs that were found directly on users’ computers or removable media connected to computers (flash drives, camera memory cards, phones, external hard drives), or which initially made their way onto the computer in non-open form (for example, programs in complex installers, encrypted files, etc.).In Q1 2020, our File Anti-Virus registered 164,653,290 malicious and potentially unwanted objects. For each country, we calculated the percentage of Kaspersky product users on whose computers File Anti-Virus was triggered during the reporting period. These statistics reflect the level of personal-computer infection in different countries.Note that this rating only includes attacks by malicious programs that fall under the Malware class; it does not include File Anti-Virus triggers in response to potentially dangerous or unwanted programs, such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 10,000). ** Unique users on whose computers Malware-class local threats were blocked as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Geography of local infection attempts, Q1 2020 (download)Overall, 19.16% of user computers globally faced at least one Malware-class local threat during Q1.","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1566 Phishing,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] These statistics are based on detection verdicts for Kaspersky products received from users who consented to providing statistical data.According to Kaspersky Security Network,Q1 2020 will be remembered primarily for the coronavirus pandemic and cybercriminals’ exploitation of the topic. In particular, the creators of a new modification of the Ginp banking trojan renamed their malware Coronavirus Finder and then began offering it for €0.75 disguised as an app supposedly capable of detecting nearby people infected with COVID-19. Thus, the cybercriminals tried not only to scam users by exploiting hot topics, but to gain access to their bank card details. And, because the trojan remains on the device after stealing this data, the cybercriminals could intercept text messages containing two-factor authorization codes and use the stolen data without the victim’s knowledge.Another interesting find this quarter was Cookiethief, a trojan designed to steal cookies from mobile browsers and the Facebook app. In the event of a successful attack, the malware provided its handler with access to the victim’s account, including the ability to perform various actions in their name, such as liking, reposting, etc. To prevent the service from spotting any abnormal activity in the hijacked profile, the trojan contains a proxy module through which the attackers issue commands.The third piece of malware that caught our attention this reporting quarter was trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Shopper.a. It is designed to help cybercriminals to leave fake reviews and drive up ratings on Google Play. The attackers’ goals here are obvious: to increase the changes of their apps getting published and recommended, and to lull the vigilance of potential victims. Note that to rate apps and write reviews, the trojan uses Accessibility Services to gain full control over the other app: in this case, the official Google Play client.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky’s mobile products and technologies detected 1,152,662 malicious installation packages, or 171,669 more than in the previous quarter.Number of malicious installation packages detected, Q1 2019 – Q1 2020 (download)Starting in Q2 2019, we have seen a steady rise in the number of mobile threats detected. Although it is too early to sound the alarm (2019 saw the lowest number of new threats in recent years), the trend is concerning.Distribution of newly detected mobile programs by type, Q1 2020 and Q4 2019 (download)Of all the threats detected in Q1, half were unwanted adware apps (49.9%), their share having increased by 19 p.p. compared to the previous quarter. Most often, we detected members of the HiddenAd and Ewind families, with a combined slice of 40% of all detected adware threats, as well as the FakeAdBlocker family (12%).Potentially unwanted RiskTool apps (28.24%) took second place; the share of this type of threat remained almost unchanged. The Smsreg (49% of all detected threats of this class), Agent (17%) and Dnotua (11%) families were the biggest contributors. Note that in Q1, the number of detected members of the Smsreg family increased by more than 50 percent.In third place were Trojan-Dropper-type threats (9.72%). Although their share decreased by 7.63 p.p. against the previous quarter, droppers remain one of the most common classes of mobile threats. Ingopack emerged as Q1’s leading family with a massive 71% of all Trojan-Dropper threats, followed by Waponor (12%) and Hqwar (8%) far behind.It is worth noting that mobile droppers are most often used for installing financial malware, although some financial threats can spread without their help. The share of these self-sufficient threats is quite substantial: in particular, the share of Trojan-Banker in Q1 increased by 2.1 p.p. to 3.65%.Note that this malware rankings do not include potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.* Unique users attacked by this malware as a percentage of all users of Kaspersky mobile products that were attacked.First place in our Top 20 as ever went to DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (44.89%), the verdict we use for malware detected using cloud technology. They are triggered when the antivirus databases still lack the data for detecting a malicious program, but the Kaspersky Security Network cloud already contains information about the object. This is basically how the latest malware is detected.Second and third places were claimed by Trojan.AndroidOS.Boogr.gsh (9.09%) and DangerousObject.AndroidOS.GenericML (7,08%) respectively. These verdicts are assigned to files that are recognized as malicious by our machine-learning systems.In fourth (Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro.d, 4.52%) and tenth (Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro.b, 1.94%) places are members of the Necro family, whose main task is to download and install modules from cybercriminal servers. Eighth-placed Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Necro.z (2.30%) acts in a similar way, extracting from itself only those modules that it needs. As for Trojan.AndroidOS.Necro.a, which took ninth place (2.19%), cybercriminals assigned it a different task: the trojan follows advertising links and clicks banner ads in the victim’s name.Trojan.AndroidOS.Hiddapp.ch (2.73%) claimed fifth spot. As soon as it runs, the malware hides its icon on the list of apps and continues to operate in the background. The trojan’s payload can be other trojan programs or adware apps.Sixth place went to Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a (2.45%), which is what Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Necro usually delivers. Helper.a is tasked with downloading arbitrary code from the cybercriminals’ server and running it.The verdict Trojan.AndroidOS.Handda.san (2.31%) in seventh place is a group of diverse trojans that hide their icons, gain Device Admin rights on the device, and use packers to evade detection.Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Rotexy.e (1.43%) and Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Penguin.e (1.42%) warrant a special mention. The former is the only banking trojan in the top 20 this past quarter. The Rotexy family is all of six years old, and its members have the functionality to steal bank card details and intercept two-factor payment authorization messages. In turn, the first member of the Penguin dropper family was only detected last July and had gained significant popularity by Q1 2020.

Geography of device IP addresses where attacks at Kaspersky SSH traps originated, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries by location of devices from which attacks were made on Kaspersky SSH traps.In Q1 2020, China (14.87%), Vietnam (11.58%) and the US (7.03%) made up the top three countries by number of unique IPs from which attacks on SSH traps originated.* Share of malware type in the total amount of malware downloaded to IoT devices following a successful attack.In Q1 2020, attackers most often downloaded the minimalistic trojan loader NyaDrop (64.35%), whose executable file does not exceed 500 KB. Threats from the Mirai family traditionally dominated: its members claimed four places in our top 10. These malicious programs will continue to rule the world of IoT threats for a long time to come, at least until the appearance of a more advanced (and publicly available) DDoS bot.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions blocked attempts to launch one or several types of malware designed to steal money from bank accounts on the computers of 249,748 users.Number of unique users attacked by financial malware, Q1 2020 (download)Attack geographyTo assess and compare the risk of being infected by banking trojans and ATM/POS malware in various countries, for each country we calculated the share of users of Kaspersky products that faced this threat during the reporting period out of all users of our products in that country.Geography of banking malware attacks, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries by share of attacked users* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky product users (under 10,000). ** Unique users whose computers were targeted by financial malware as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Top 10 banking malware families** Unique users attacked by this malware family as a percentage of all users attacked by financial malware.Ransomware attacks on organizations, as well as on city and municipal networks, did not ease off. Given how lucrative they are for cybercriminals, there is no reason why this trend of several years should cease.More and more ransomware is starting to supplement encryption with data theft. To date, this tactic has been adopted by distributors of ransomware families, including Maze, REvil/Sodinokibi, DoppelPaymer and JSWorm/Nemty/Nefilim. If the victim refuses to pay the ransom for decryption (because, say, the data was recovered from a backup copy), the attackers threaten to put the stolen confidential information in the public domain. Such threats are sometimes empty, but not always: the authors of several ransomware programs have set up websites that do indeed publish the data of victim organizations.In Q1 2020, we detected five new ransomware families and 5,225 new modifications of these malware programs.Number of new ransomware modifications detected, Q1 2019 – Q1 2020 (download)In Q1 2020, Kaspersky products and technologies protected 178,922 users from ransomware attacks.Number of unique users attacked by ransomware trojans, Q1 2020 (download) Geography of attacks by ransomware trojans, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries attacked by ransomware trojans* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 50,000). ** Unique users whose computers were attacked by ransomware trojans as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Trojan-Ransom.Win32.PolyRansom* Unique Kaspersky users attacked by the specified family of ransomware trojans as a percentage of all users attacked by ransomware trojans.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions detected 192,036 new miner modifications.Number of new miner modifications, Q1 2020 (download)In Q1, we detected attacks using miners on the computers of 518,857 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products worldwide.Number of unique users attacked by miners, Q1 2020 (download) Geography of miner attacks, Q1 2020 (download)Top 10 countries attacked by miners* Excluded are countries with relatively few users of Kaspersky products (under 50,000). ** Unique users whose computers were attacked by miners as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.We already noted that Microsoft Office vulnerabilities are the most common ones. Q1 2020 was no exception: the share of exploits for these vulnerabilities grew to 74.83%. The most popular vulnerability in Microsoft Office was CVE-2017-11882, which is related to a stack overflow error in the Equation Editor component. Hard on its heels was CVE-2017-8570, which is used to embed a malicious script in an OLE object inside an Office document. Several other vulnerabilities, such as CVE-2018-0802 and CVE-2017-8759, were also popular with attackers. In the absence of security updates for Microsoft Office, these vulnerabilities are successfully exploited and the user’s system becomes infected.In second place were exploits for vulnerabilities in Internet browsers (11.06%). In Q1, cybercriminals attacked a whole host of browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. What’s more, some of the vulnerabilities were used in APT attacks, such as CVE-2020-0674, which is associated with the incorrect handling of objects in memory in an outdated version of the JScript scripting engine in Internet Explorer, leading to code execution. Another example is the previously identified CVE-2019-17026, a data type mismatch vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox’s JIT compiler, which also leads to remote code execution. In the event of a successful attack, both browser exploits cause a malware infection. The researchers also detected a targeted attack against Google Chrome exploiting the RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-6418 in the JavaScript engine; in addition, the dangerous RCE vulnerability CVE-2020-0767 was detected in a component of the ChakraCore scripting engine used by Microsoft Edge. Although modern browsers have their own protection mechanisms, cybercriminals are forever finding ways around them, very often using chains of exploits to do so. Therefore, it is vital to keep the operating system and software up to date at all times.Distribution of exploits used in attacks by type of application attacked, Q1 2020 (download)This quarter, a wide range of critical vulnerabilities were detected in operating systems and their components.Various network attacks on system services and network protocols were as popular as ever with attackers. We continue to detect attempts at exploiting vulnerabilities in the SMB protocol using EternalBlue, EternalRomance and similar sets of exploits. In Q1 2020, the new vulnerability CVE-2020-0796 (SMBGhost) was detected in the SMBv3 network protocol, leading to remote code execution, in which regard the attacker does not even need to know the username/password combination (since the error occurs before the authentication stage); however, it is present only in Windows 10. In Remote Desktop Gateway there were found two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-0609 and CVE-2020-0610) enabling an unauthorized user to execute remote code in the target system. In addition, there were more frequent attempts to brute-force passwords to Remote Desktop Services and Microsoft SQL Server via the SMB protocol as well.The statistics in this section are based on Web Anti-Virus, which protects users when malicious objects are downloaded from malicious/infected web pages. Malicious websites are specially created by cybercriminals; web resources with user-created content (for example, forums), as well as hacked legitimate resources, can be infected.The following statistics show the distribution by country of the sources of Internet attacks blocked by Kaspersky products on user computers (web pages with redirects to exploits, sites containing exploits and other malicious programs, botnet C&C centers, etc.). Any unique host could be the source of one or more web-based attacks.To determine the geographical source of web-based attacks, domain names are matched against their actual domain IP addresses, and then the geographical location of a specific IP address (GEOIP) is established.In Q1 2020, Kaspersky solutions defeated 726,536,269 attacks launched from online resources located in 203 countries worldwide. As many as 442,039,230 unique URLs were recognized as malicious by Web Anti-Virus components.Distribution of web-based attack sources by country, Q1 2020 (download)To assess the risk of online infection faced by users in different countries, for each country, we calculated the percentage of Kaspersky users on whose computers Web Anti-Virus was triggered during the quarter. The resulting data provides an indication of the aggressiveness of the environment in which computers operate in different countries.This rating only includes attacks by malicious programs that fall under the Malware class; it does not include Web Anti-Virus detections of potentially dangerous or unwanted programs such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 10,000). ** Unique users targeted by Malware-class attacks as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.These statistics are based on detection verdicts returned by the Web Anti-Virus module that were received from users of Kaspersky products who consented to providing statistical data.On average, 6.56% of Internet user’ computers worldwide experienced at least one Malware-class attack.Geography of malicious web-based attacks, Q1 2020 (download)In this section, we analyze statistical data obtained from the OAS and ODS modules in Kaspersky products. It takes into account malicious programs that were found directly on users’ computers or removable media connected to computers (flash drives, camera memory cards, phones, external hard drives), or which initially made their way onto the computer in non-open form (for example, programs in complex installers, encrypted files, etc.).In Q1 2020, our File Anti-Virus registered 164,653,290 malicious and potentially unwanted objects. For each country, we calculated the percentage of Kaspersky product users on whose computers File Anti-Virus was triggered during the reporting period. These statistics reflect the level of personal-computer infection in different countries.Note that this rating only includes attacks by malicious programs that fall under the Malware class; it does not include File Anti-Virus triggers in response to potentially dangerous or unwanted programs, such as RiskTool or adware.* Excluded are countries with relatively few Kaspersky users (under 10,000). ** Unique users on whose computers Malware-class local threats were blocked as a percentage of all unique users of Kaspersky products in the country.Geography of local infection attempts, Q1 2020 (download)Overall, 19.16% of user computers globally faced at least one Malware-class local threat during Q1.

"Popular NoSQL database MongoDB has released an update that patches a critical denial-of-service vulnerability. MongoDB, a popular NoSQL database used in big data and heavy analytics environments, has patched a serious denial-of-service vulnerability that is remotely exploitable. Companies using the default installation of MongoDB, which does not require authentication to access the database, are urged to update immediately to a patched version, and set up authentication. Hackers using a Shodan query or scanning the Internet for vulnerable installations, can easily find MongoDB servers online. According to the MongoDB website, large organizations such as MetLife, Bosch, Expedia, and The Weather Channel have the database in production for a variety of uses. Researchers at Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs discovered the vulnerability in separate areas of MongoDB on Feb. 20 and 23 respectively, and disclosed privately immediately to MongoDB, which made updates available on March 17. “A potential attacker doesn’t have to be authenticated or have rights to the database to exploit the vulnerability,” said Aamir Lakhani, security strategist, FortiGuard Labs. “All they have to do is send a crafted packet, a particular regex query, to crash the database.” According to an advisory on the Fortinet website, the vulnerability is in an old PCRE library (8.30) of regular expressions used in MongoDB querying. MongoDB patched the library in version 3.0.1 and 2.6.9, the last two major releases in production. Up-to-date versions of MongoDB ship with a patched version of PCRE (8.36 and beyond). “I would say a skilled attacker who understands regex wouldn’t have too much of a difficult time with this attack, especially after examining the code,” Lakhani said. “Some things would stand out with a skilled attacker. And at some point as usually happens with these things, someone will automate it or develop a Metasploit plugin that will make an exploit easy to execute.” Cutting into that simplicity would be the enablement of authentication. “You can set up Mongo to ensure authentication is required. It’s the recommended best practice,” Lakhani said. “If Mongo is set up in a way that does not allow for anonymous access, at that point, an anonymous user cannot run an attack. But if a user has legitimate credentials, they can execute the same attack.” The Fortinet exploit is basically a regular expression that meets a number of conditions that would cause the database to crash. Variants of the crafted regex work, Fortinet said, but it did not disclose the details. “There are several ways to carry out an attack against this vulnerability,” Lakhani said. “The most common is to connect to the MongoDB server through a website query or using a MongoDB client tool to connect to the server. The attacker puts in a regex string with an input field where MongoDB reads it and processes the input. As soon as it looks at the packet, the server is taken down. “The risk is that system is down until services are restarted, and sometimes that requires manual intervention from an administrator,” Lakhani said. : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] Popular NoSQL database MongoDB has released an update that patches a critical denial-of-service vulnerability.

"The 2014 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Quarterly takes a look back at Heartbleed and how organizations were affected by it. On the one hand, the total number of vendor-reported vulnerabilities are down so far this year. On the other, 2014 was the year of the Heartbleed, the common name for a vulnerability in the nearly ubiquitous OpenSSL’s encryption implementation library, which IBM Security Systems characterized as “one of the most widespread and impactful security vulnerabilities of all time.” Heartbleed is a well-known bug in OpenSSL, a popular open-source protocol used extensively on the Internet to implement SSL and TLS encryption. The vulnerability can be exploited to access and read the memory of systems thought to be protected by encryption, including secret cryptography keys, usernames, passwords and even content. The bug became public knowledge on April 7, but is believed to have existed for at least two years before that. By April 8, a proof-of-concept exploit emerged. While a fix for Heartbleed was prepared and ready for installment by almost immediately, the bug remained a potent one even after it was no longer a zero-day because of the ubiquity of OpenSSL. One-day attacks, IBM explains, can be just as dangerous as zero-day attacks because attackers are racing to exploit a given bug before it’s patch is widely implemented. Part of the problem, according to the IBM Threat Intelligence Quarterly report, is that organizations not only needed to patch their own systems, but they had to wait for third-party software vendors to find and fix the bug and then test the fix in the products they used but did not control. IBM says it began seeing attacks targeting the bug on the same day that the exploit PoC emerged. The highest volume of attacks occurred, they say, on April 15 when there were more than 300,000 attacks targeting IBM Managed Security Services (MSS) clients in one day. Attacks slowed down after April 22. However, IBM claims that nearly half of all affected systems remain unpatched and that it sees some 7,000 attacks within MSS each day. “Organizations that had struggled to maintain a current asset database were left blind to which systems were vulnerable and which systems were critical,” they said. Conversely, companies that maintained accurate asset databases and incident response plans were able to rapidly deploy patches on vulnerable systems. Not only did they reduce their exposure to Heartbleed, but they will face less risk to similar vulnerabilities moving forward. IBM has six suggestions for preparing for Internet-wide bugs before they emerge: organizations should keep up with threat intelligence; maintain a current ans accurate asset inventory; have a patching solution that covers the entire infrastructure; implement mitigating controls like firewalls, intrusion prevention systems and endpoint protection; use effective detection so it is clear when networks are under attack; and have a clear, broad and thoroughly tested incident response plan in place. IBM also claims that the impact of Heartbleed was increased because OpenSSL is an open-source tool. “Typically, attackers first need to identify the code that has been patched in response to a vulnerability. For open-source projects, this is a straightforward task because they can simply review publicly accessible source-code repositories and source-code check-ins relating to the vulnerability. For closed-source applications, they can use a process called ‘binary diffing’ to find which parts of the binary code have changed, narrowing it down to changed functions and, eventually, the vulnerable code.” For skilled attackers, locating vulnerable open-source code take minutes as opposed to hours for closed source. Once the code is located, the attacker then has to create an exploit. Unfortunately, that part of the process was already taken care of in the case of Heartbleed. More broadly, IBM, who’s been tracking vulnerability disclosure since 1997, says the total number of vulnerabilities are down this year–more than 3,900 new security vulnerabilities affecting 926 unique vendors. If that number remains steady, 2014 will be the first year since 2011 in which fewer than 8,000 vulnerabilities are disclosed by vendors. Similarly, the number of vendors disclosing vulnerabilities has decreased year over year; 1,602 vendors reported bugs in 2013 compared to 926 vendors in 2014. During that time, the number of vulnerabilities disclosed by the largest enterprises remains relatively unchanged, accounting for 34 percent of disclosures in 2013 and 32 percent so far this year. Specifically, bugs in content management systems (CMS) seem to be among the most reported this year, accounting for nearly 10 percent of all bugs. Of these CMS vulnerabilities, most exist in plug-ins. This is a problem because the plug-ins are often developed by third parties, and these third parties very often consist of and are maintained by one person or a small group who either don’t patch or patch infrequently, IBM says. Therefore, many plug-ins contain unpatched security vulnerabilities that are incredibly tempting to attackers. The Mayhem Virus is one such example. IBM says it sought to compromise web servers through CMS vulnerabilities and then perform brute-force attacks of weak or default credentials. “After these web servers are compromised, they can be used to serve malware or carry out large-scale, high-bandwidth distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against other sites and targets,” IBM wrote in its report. “For example, WordPress was used in an amplification DDoS attack in March 2014 that affected more than 162,000 sites.” IBM also notes that the critical vulnerability scoring system (CVSS), in which 67 percent of vulnerabilities are medium-severity and 24 percent are high-severity, needs to be updated. “The most obvious example of how some CVSS scores do not always represent true risk and impact to an organization is the Heartbleed vulnerability,” they explain. “As mentioned earlier in this report, Heartbleed was disclosed in April 2014, but it had actually existed for two years. This vulnerability received a CVSS base score of 5.0, which falls into the medium-risk level—along with 67 percent of all other vulnerabilities reported during the first half of 2014.” “However, with the number of products impacted, the time and attention IT teams spent patching systems and responding to customer inquiries, as well as the potential sensitivity of data exposed, the true impact of the Heartbleed vulnerability was greater than the CVSS base score would indicate. This also brings to question what other vulnerabilities fell into the medium-risk category (CVSS base score 4.0 to 6.9) that may have been disregarded by organizations, but that also had potential large-scale impacts similar to Heartbleed.” : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] The 2014 IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Quarterly takes a look back at Heartbleed and how organizations were affected by it.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes National Cybersecurity Awareness Month is now well underway, and this year’s theme is “Own IT. Secure IT. Protect IT.” The core message is simple: today’s businesses and consumers must take key proactive steps to ensure their online privacy and devices’ security. This means using strong passwords, taking advantage of multi-factor authentication (MFA), and understanding the risks of phishing attacks and social media-based scams. But most importantly, it means increasing your awareness of—and visibility into—what’s already on the devices you own. The number of endpoint devices connecting to enterprise networks continues to climb rapidly. Not only are organizations issuing multiple devices to individual employees (for instance, both a tablet and laptop computer), but they’re also increasingly providing network connectivity to employee-owned devices as well as those of vendors, partners, and guests. Yet the majority of successful data breaches begin with the compromise of an endpoint device. According to recent research from IDC and the Ponemon Institute, between two-thirds and 70% of data breaches might have been prevented with stronger endpoint security. The natural result of the rapid proliferation of connected devices is a larger attack surface, and thus, organizations face greater security risks. One of the biggest challenges posed by the proliferation of connected devices is visibility. As ever-greater numbers of endpoints become part of business IT ecosystems, it’s increasingly difficult for security teams to see, understand, and control which files are stored or executed, which operating system actions initiated, or which IP addresses contacted from all of them at all times.  A single, simple tool allows you to see 100% of threats Even as information security spending continues to climb, IT security teams remain constrained by limited resources. There simply aren’t enough skilled professionals available to meet businesses’ need for thorough monitoring of networks, endpoints, and Internet-facing applications. Tools that are streamlined and efficient to use and that enhance teams’ ability to see what’s taking place at the most vulnerable points in the IT environment can have a major impact in terms of risk reduction. Legacy anti-malware solutions work by comparing each file on your system to a library of known malicious files. Any with signatures matching those of files on the blacklist are quarantined or removed from the device. But how many files currently stored or running on endpoint devices in your environment aren’t known to be malware, but can’t be definitively identified as safe, either? Few of today’s IT leaders or CISOs can even begin to answer this question. Today’s IT environments are simply too complex, and endpoint devices contain billions of files of various and diverse origin. Yet any one of the unknown files residing on an endpoint device in your environment might bear the seeds of an attack that might ultimately cause millions of dollars in damage to the business.  Comodo Forensic Analysis Tool offers complete visibility for free Now available for zero-cost, no-obligation download, the Comodo Forensic Analysis Tool will detect all known malicious files on any Windows endpoint device. It will also tell you how many known safe files are present, and it will give an accurate count of the unknown files residing there. In essence, it gives you full and comprehensive visibility into that endpoint’s risk profile—in quantitative terms—and does so quickly and easily. All files on the system in question, as well as associated active directory, network addresses and user workgroups will be analyzed, with quick scan results returned in less than ten minutes. Running the Forensic Analysis Tool is a simple step, but it’s also a way of beginning to address a complex problem—visibility into the ever-growing numbers of connected endpoints in today’s IT environments. You can download the tool and get full results today, or contact us to learn more about today’s most advanced endpoint security solutions.

Not only are organizations issuing multiple devices to individual employees (for instance, both a tablet and laptop computer), but they’re also increasingly providing network connectivity to employee-owned devices as well as those of vendors, partners, and guests. Yet the majority of successful data breaches begin with the compromise of an endpoint device. According to recent research from IDC and the Ponemon Institute, between two-thirds and 70% of data breaches might have been prevented with stronger endpoint security. The natural result of the rapid proliferation of connected devices is a larger attack surface, and thus, organizations face greater security risks. One of the biggest challenges posed by the proliferation of connected devices is visibility. As ever-greater numbers of endpoints become part of business IT ecosystems, it’s increasingly difficult for security teams to see, understand, and control which files are stored or executed, which operating system actions initiated, or which IP addresses contacted from all of them at all times.  A single, simple tool allows you to see 100% of threats Even as information security spending continues to climb, IT security teams remain constrained by limited resources. There simply aren’t enough skilled professionals available to meet businesses’ need for thorough monitoring of networks, endpoints, and Internet-facing applications. Tools that are streamlined and efficient to use and that enhance teams’ ability to see what’s taking place at the most vulnerable points in the IT environment can have a major impact in terms of risk reduction. Legacy anti-malware solutions work by comparing each file on your system to a library of known malicious files. Any with signatures matching those of files on the blacklist are quarantined or removed from the device. But how many files currently stored or running on endpoint devices in your environment aren’t known to be malware, but can’t be definitively identified as safe, either? Few of today’s IT leaders or CISOs can even begin to answer this question. Today’s IT environments are simply too complex, and endpoint devices contain billions of files of various and diverse origin. Yet any one of the unknown files residing on an endpoint device in your environment might bear the seeds of an attack that might ultimately cause millions of dollars in damage to the business.  Comodo Forensic Analysis Tool offers complete visibility for free Now available for zero-cost, no-obligation download, the Comodo Forensic Analysis Tool will detect all known malicious files on any Windows endpoint device. It will also tell you how many known safe files are present, and it will give an accurate count of the unknown files residing there. In essence, it gives you full and comprehensive visibility into that endpoint’s risk profile—in quantitative terms—and does so quickly and easily. All files on the system in question, as well as associated active directory, network addresses and user workgroups will be analyzed, with quick scan results returned in less than ten minutes. Running the Forensic Analysis Tool is a simple step, but it’s also a way of beginning to address a complex problem—visibility into the ever-growing numbers of connected endpoints in today’s IT environments. You can download the tool and get full results today, or contact us to learn more about today’s most advanced endpoint security solutions.

"From a zero day flaw in WhatsApp, to Patch Tuesday fixes, Threatpost breaks down the top vulnerabilities of this week. This week was filled with flaws, flaws and more flaws: From a zero-day under active exploit in the WhatsApp messaging app, to Patch Tuesday glitches addressed by Microsoft. Threatpost breaks down the top vulnerabilities of the week, including: A WhatsApp zero-day vulnerability being exploited in targeted spyware attacks Several Cisco vulnerabilities, including a critical remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager; and an unpatched, high-severity Secure Boot flaw that was disclosed on Monday A new class of speculative execution vulnerabilities in all modern Intel CPUs, dubbed Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) A Microsoft patch released on Patch Tuesday for an elevation-of-privileges vulnerability rated important, which is being exploited in the wild Apple rolling out 173 patches in various products across its hardware portfolio, including for dangerous bugs in macOS for laptops and desktops, iPhone, Apple TV and Apple Watch. Click here for direct download. Below find a lightly-edited transcription of the news wrap podcast for the week ended May 17.  Lindsey O’Donnell: Welcome to the Threatpost news wrap podcast for the week ended may 17. You’ve got the Threatpost team here, which is myself, Lindsey O’Donnell, as well as editors Tara Seals and Tom spring. How’s everyone doing? Tara Seals: Hey, Lindsey. Tom Spring: Lindsey, hey. Lindsey: I feel like the big news of the week really revolved around just a ton of vulnerabilities. We had some interesting Microsoft flaws that were disclosed and fixed on Tuesday. But then there was also a zero-day flaw revealed in the WhatsApp messaging platform. There were some new side channel flaws revealed in Intel CPUs. There were Apple, Adobe patches. So just a whirlwind of vulnerabilities. So crazy. Tom: Yeah, it was, it was pretty nuts. And, you know, we still have some of the week left to see some more patching. And you know, we’re just really scratching the surface with what we covered. I mean, there were so many patches this week. We couldn’t cover them all. I know that, who else had patches –  Schneider Electric. And I mean, it just ran the gamut. I just kept on seeing US-CERT alerts in my inbox all week long. Lindsey: Yeah, it’s been crazy. I’m sure we won’t even see the end of it for this week. Tom, you led Tuesday off with some nice coverage of Microsoft Patch Tuesday. I mean, it looked like there was a zero day bug that you wrote about that was under active attack. What were some of the main takeaways there? Tom: Well, you know, it was really interesting Patch Tuesday. There were sort of your garden variety of vulnerabilities that were patched and then there was one mysterious one where they didn’t really get into the technical specifics of it. And that was actually a zero day that Microsoft reported, that was being exploited in the wild. And it wasn’t a critical vulnerability. I believe it was an important vulnerability if I’m not mistaken. And it was tied to the Windows Error Reporting System. And that is essentially a Windows version of event feedback infrastructure kind of thing, where hardware and software problems are detected, and you report back to Microsoft, but the vulnerability, again, it was a little mysterious in terms of what Microsoft was sharing regarding this vulnerability. I think they were very sensitive to the fact that it was being exploited in the wild. And we’ll probably learn more about it as the days come. But, that was really an interesting vulnerability, right? Anything that’s being exploited in the wild and zero day is always interesting to me. But then there was this other vulnerability. And I don’t know  who coined the name of the vulnerability. I’m seeing it more and more today for the first time. It’s called a Bluekeep vulnerability. And this was a critical patch. So this Bluekeep vulnerability impacted the Remote Desktop Services within Windows. And what made it really interesting was that it didn’t affect newer systems, new Window systems – It affected older systems, such as Windows 7, Windows Server 2008. And it was also a “Wormable” flaw, meaning that if exploited, we could have had the potential of seeing something along the lines of the worm, WannaCry,  the ransomware malware of 2017. Microsoft was warning that this was a really bad one, this was a really nasty one. And then that likely there were exploits being developed in the wild. And this one could cause some serious problems. So again, really interesting that Microsoft was releasing patches for unsupported operating systems and that they were giving such a harsh warning on this one. It was really interesting, in terms of Patch Tuesday, and then I’m going to kick this right off to you, Lindsey. They also had a lot of notifications, a lot of information and some patching mitigation information on the Intel flaws, which was another huge patch, a vulnerability that we learned about this week. Right? Lindsey: Yeah. So basically, if you remember Spectre and Meltdown, Intel revealed a new class of similar types of vulnerabilities which are side-channel flaws that take advantage of a process called speculative execution in CPUs. So Intel came out on Tuesday and disclosed a new class of side channel flaws that were impacting all modern Intel chips back to, I think 2011 was the oldest generation that was impacted, and basically, these types of attacks can potentially leak sensitive data from a system CPU. And it was a little confusing because a lot of the different names were being thrown around for the various flaws and the various attacks, but from a high level Intel said that the new class of flaws is called microarchitectural data sampling or MDS. It’s funny because the attacks themselves, which were discovered and disclosed by various researchers, all had much more, in my opinion, interesting names. One of them was called Zombieload and the other was called Fallout. So it’s kind of funny putting those up to Intel’s names. But basically, this has been the accumulation of about a year of working to report and disclose and offer mitigation for these types of flaws. And I think that there were just so many different researchers who were involved in in various flaws and attacks for this. So it was just a lot of effort from different researchers working to disclose these flaws. Tom: Yeah, I found it really interesting. I read somewhere that a patched processor was going to see a 9 percent performance hit. I mean, it really begs the question how many people are going to want to patch something where you’re going to see that type of performance hit on your system to obtain that level of security? You know, it’ll be interesting to watch. Lindsey: Yeah, no, it’s definitely a good point. That was part of all of it. And so, you know, as you mentioned, Intel has offered mitigation but then in addition to those mitigations for existing CPUs, they also said that the flaw will be addressed in hardware starting with select eighth and ninth generation Intel Core processors, and second gen Intel Xeon scalable processors, and then future chips will have integrated fixes as well. But beyond what Intel’s doing, Tom, like you mentioned, we saw a bunch of different OEMs roll out their own scheduled update processes to correlate with these flaws such as Red Hat, Oracle, Microsoft, Apple. So, you know, this was really an effort that had waves across the industry. And I mean, from my perspective I think it’s just another indication that side channel speculative execution attacks are not going anywhere – they’re going to continue to plague the chip industry. Back in August even beyond Spectre and Meltdown we saw Foreshadow, I think that this will just continue, unfortunately. Tom: Yeah, well, it’s interesting that these most recent flaws are not impacting any other chips, if I’m not mistaken, other than Intel, is that correct? Lindsey: Yeah. So AMD came out and said that they are not impacted. Tom: You know, the one thing I keep waiting for is Spectre and Meltdown attacks. I mean, I know that there’s tons of proof of concepts. I’m grateful that we haven’t and I don’t know if it’s just a matter of time. Tara: I actually had a question on that, Lindsey, because I know I covered the Apple updates, and they had addressed the side channel flaws. And they said that in the case of Apple, all of their Macbooks are impacted going back to 2011. And so it’s obviously a concern for Mac users everywhere to apply these updates and kind of get things up to speed but what was interesting is that they said that danger was only really from local attackers. There was no sort of remote way to exploit this. Is that the intel that you have as well? Lindsey: Intel definitely came forward and said that it would be difficult to attack these vulnerabilities. I think that they made note that I think on the CVSS scale, the flaws basically range from between just over three out of 10, up to I think it was like 6.5 out of 10. So they’re not really critical flaws. I think people take note of these types of flaws, because they are just something that’s going to continue to plague the industry. And so I think that’s kind of why it got all the news coverage that it did at this point. Tara: Yeah. And there’s just so widespread. Lindsey: So but Tara, I know that you were also covering patches of your own. I know Cisco had some interesting flaws, anything that you saw, anything kind of interesting there? Tara: Yeah, so there were a couple of things. So, first of all, you know, Cisco has an unpatched bug that they disclosed on Monday that we covered, that impacts literally millions and millions of devices. It basically exists on almost every single piece of hardware that they sell into the enterprise business market, so you know, that that’s a concern, obviously. And it’s a high severity vulnerability that makes it possible for a remote code execution. So, you know, it’s not a trivial bug by any stretch of the imagination. So I really was interested to cover that and a little bit shocked, to be honest, in terms of exactly how many enterprise military government networks are affected by it. Tom: You know, Cisco had one of the most prolific bug reporting months I think I’ve ever recalled in recent history, I know that both Lindsey and I have also covered Cisco patches all month long,  I kind of feel like I want to give them credit for being as transparent as they are being right out there with all of their bugs. And I also kind of want to be critical them for having so many bugs, you know, and it’s kind of a chicken and egg thing because just given the sheer amount of gear that they put out there in the marketplace. So, you know, from a sheer volume perspective, it’s probably maybe surprising they don’t have more to be honest, but some of these businesses tend to be, you know, really impacting, because they have such a huge installed footprint of stuff out there. Tara: The one that I just mentioned exists in the Secure Boot hardware that they use. That’s their trusted execution environment. So, you know, again, it’s something to take notice of, and then, you know, they also issued a ton of patches and updates yesterday and today, one of which was an update to that unpatched bag saying that in some cases, they won’t even be able to issue fixes until as late as November depending on what the products that is so, you know, they are being very transparent, but it’s also a little bit alarming once you pull back the covers on some of this stuff, because it’s not really just another patch, or another bug. Tom: so I’m going to put on my tin foil hat for two seconds, and come up with a cockamamie theory that has to do with Huawei. And some of the accusations that back doors exist within their networking in their telecom gear. And I think wow, we don’t have to go there. But I think there’s a sense that when you take a look at some other companies, and you take a look at some of the bugs, those could be perceived as on the same level as a vulnerability as perceived within Huawei. And I wonder whether or not Cisco is going bending over backwards to make sure that, you know, there’s no perception that it’s not trying to patch every single bug within its product catalog. Tara: I think that’s a really good point. Actually, there are a couple of really good points there. One is that, just the sheer amount of coding effort that it’s probably taking to address all the different bags that they have is probably kind of herculean, props to them for that, and for investing in it and being transparent about it. But the other point that you made about Huawei and the other telecom suppliers is that they underlie everything that we use every single day. It’s sort of against the Intel side channel flaws. No one is immune right and Huawei is one of the top five telecom manufacturers out there. Cisco actually issued a critical patch for a telecom bag today that impacts the management interface that service providers use – the full range of types of service providers out there that are serving millions and millions and millions of customers across the US and other countries. You know, this bag impacts all of them because it is in their core network management software. And it allows remote code execution without any sort of authentic authentication by the attacker, you can just kind of get in there and do your thing, and then boom, all of a sudden, millions of subscribers are potentially impacted by it. So it’s… an infiltrate once and impacts billions of potential and points. Tom: No, I hear you. I mean, there’s a there’s a lot a lot at stake. And, and I guess, again, it’s like one cancels out the other, kudos to them for their transparency. But let’s get the code right the first time. Lindsey: Yeah, and that’s interesting, too, because that bug that you were just talking about Tara was disclosed after all their other fixes as well, right? Tara: Initially, they disclosed it on Wednesday. But then on Thursday, they issued an updated advisory for it that clarifies what exactly was vulnerable, how severe it was in terms of what all was impacted. Tom: You know, I think we were all impacted by bugs. I feel like I’m gonna take a shower after this. Lindsey: We didn’t even talk about the WhatsApp bug either. Tom: Oh yeah, that’s how you covered the WhatsApp bag, which was a huge story. That was a huge story. Tara: Yeah. Oh my God, this has been a whirlwind. Doesn’t it just kind of set the tone for the week for sure? So what was that all about? I have to confess it’s been so busy with other patches. I didn’t really delve too far into that, Lindsey. Lindsey: Yeah, so over the weekend, a zero day vulnerability was disclosed in the WhatsApp messaging platform. And it was exploited by attackers in targeted attacks. Not widespread but they were able to inject spyware onto victims phones in using this app. And what stuck out about the attack was that all you had to do is call someone on their WhatsApp app. And then that was how you were able to exploit the flaw and then install the spyware. Tara: Oh my gosh. Lindsey: So the WhatsApp flaw is now patched but you know, obviously that gained a lot of media coverage because first of all it was in an end to end encryption type of form of communications and that had people unnerved. And then the other aspect of it was this whole part about how the spyware us seem very similar to that of that is sold by the NSO Group. That kind of led a lot of people to go up in arms there. But basically, the NSO Group is finding itself in some hot water after that. Tara: Yeah. So sort of an unintended consequences kind of story. Lindsey: Yeah, I keep seeing new stories about the NSO Group, you know, because it has this Pegasus spyware that it sells and lets governments use. And basically, a lot of human rights types of companies are saying, well, this is being used against government dissidents, it’s being used against human rights activists. So I think that there’s kind of a lot of controversy there already. Tara: For sure. Like, I remember Amnesty International actually came out not too long ago saying that Pegasus have been used, or alleging that the Pegasus had been used against some of its representatives. And so yeah, it’s been a human rights story for a while. And meanwhile, and so as you pointed out, you know, they keep saying oh, no, we that our clients very carefully we only trade with, you know, governments that are on the up and up and there’s no issue with our business model, so it’s a “he said she said” sort of situation, but when you get evidence, like what, has turned up in this WhatsApp situation, it kind of makes you think for sure. Lindsey: Speaking of Amnesty International after all this happened, they and a couple of other human rights groups said that they plan to file a petition in Israeli court to revoke and NSO Group’s export license, which would bar the company from making export transactions for its products. So we’ll see kind of how that works out. But definitely an interesting part of the entire story. Well I hope next week, we don’t have as many flaws as we did this week. Tara: Yes, yes, indeed. Lindsey: Well, Tom, Tara, thanks for coming on to the Threatpost news wrap to talk a little bit about the patch craziness this week. Tom: My pleasure. Thanks so much, Lindsay.

Tom: You know, I think we were all impacted by bugs. I feel like I’m gonna take a shower after this. Lindsey: We didn’t even talk about the WhatsApp bug either. Tom: Oh yeah, that’s how you covered the WhatsApp bag, which was a huge story. That was a huge story. Tara: Yeah. Oh my God, this has been a whirlwind. Doesn’t it just kind of set the tone for the week for sure? So what was that all about? I have to confess it’s been so busy with other patches. I didn’t really delve too far into that, Lindsey. Lindsey: Yeah, so over the weekend, a zero day vulnerability was disclosed in the WhatsApp messaging platform. And it was exploited by attackers in targeted attacks. Not widespread but they were able to inject spyware onto victims phones in using this app. And what stuck out about the attack was that all you had to do is call someone on their WhatsApp app. And then that was how you were able to exploit the flaw and then install the spyware. Tara: Oh my gosh. Lindsey: So the WhatsApp flaw is now patched but you know, obviously that gained a lot of media coverage because first of all it was in an end to end encryption type of form of communications and that had people unnerved. And then the other aspect of it was this whole part about how the spyware us seem very similar to that of that is sold by the NSO Group. That kind of led a lot of people to go up in arms there. But basically, the NSO Group is finding itself in some hot water after that. Tara: Yeah. So sort of an unintended consequences kind of story. Lindsey: Yeah, I keep seeing new stories about the NSO Group, you know, because it has this Pegasus spyware that it sells and lets governments use. And basically, a lot of human rights types of companies are saying, well, this is being used against government dissidents, it’s being used against human rights activists. So I think that there’s kind of a lot of controversy there already. Tara: For sure. Like, I remember Amnesty International actually came out not too long ago saying that Pegasus have been used, or alleging that the Pegasus had been used against some of its representatives. And so yeah, it’s been a human rights story for a while. And meanwhile, and so as you pointed out, you know, they keep saying oh, no, we that our clients very carefully we only trade with, you know, governments that are on the up and up and there’s no issue with our business model, so it’s a “he said she said” sort of situation, but when you get evidence, like what, has turned up in this WhatsApp situation, it kind of makes you think for sure. Lindsey: Speaking of Amnesty International after all this happened, they and a couple of other human rights groups said that they plan to file a petition in Israeli court to revoke and NSO Group’s export license, which would bar the company from making export transactions for its products. So we’ll see kind of how that works out. But definitely an interesting part of the entire story. Well I hope next week, we don’t have as many flaws as we did this week. Tara: Yes, yes, indeed. Lindsey: Well, Tom, Tara, thanks for coming on to the Threatpost news wrap to talk a little bit about the patch craziness this week. Tom: My pleasure. Thanks so much, Lindsay.

"The plugin, installed on hundreds of thousands of sites, allows anyone to filch database info without having to be logged in. WP Statistics, a plugin installed on more than 600,000 WordPress websites, has an SQL-injection security vulnerability that could let site visitors make off with all kinds of sensitive information from web databases, including emails, credit-card data, passwords and more. WP Statistics, as its name suggests, is a plugin that delivers analytics for site owners, including how many people visit the site, where they\u2019re coming from, what browsers and search engines they use, and which pages, categories and tags have the most visits.

It returns this data using SQL queries to a back-end database \u2013 but it turns out that unauthenticated attackers can hijack the function to perform their own queries, in order to purloin sensitive information. \u201cWhile the \u2018Pages\u2019 page was intended for administrators only and would not display information to non-admin users, it was possible to start loading this page\u2019s constructor by sending a request to wp-admin/admin.php with the page parameter set to wps_pages_page,\u201d said Wordfence researchers in a posting this week. \u201cSince the SQL query ran in the constructor for the \u2018Pages\u2019 page, this meant that any site visitor, even those without a login, could cause this SQL query to run. A malicious actor could then supply malicious values for the ID or type parameters.\u201d The specific vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection, according to researchers at Wordfence. This technique involves sending requests to the database that \u201cguess\u201d at the content of a database table and instruct the database to delay the response or \u201csleep\u201d if that guess is correct. For instance, an attacker could ask the database if the first letter of the admin user\u2019s email address starts with the letter \u201cA,\u201d and instruct it to delay the response by five seconds if this is true. \u201cExfiltrating information would be a relatively slow process, and it would be impractical to use it to extract bulk records, but high-value information such as user emails, password hashes, and encryption keys and salts could be extracted in a matter of hours with the help of automated tools such as sqlmap,\u201d according to Wordfence. \u201cIn a targeted attack, this vulnerability could be used to extract personally identifiable information from commerce sites containing customer information. This underscores the importance of having security protections with an endpoint firewall in place wherever sensitive data is stored.\u201d The only reliable method of preventing SQL injection is to prepare all SQL statements before executing them, researchers added. Prepared statements isolate each query parameter so that an adversary would not be able to see the entire scope of the data that\u2019s returned. \u201cUnfortunately, while this SQL query used esc_sql to attempt to escape the ID and type input parameters, it did not use a prepared statement,\u201d explained the researchers. \u201cSince the ID input parameter was not quoted, it was trivial to bypass the esc_sql function and generate queries which could be used to extract sensitive information from the site.\u201d VeronaLabs, the plugin\u2019s developer, has released a patch with version 13.0.8, so site administrators should update as quickly as possible.

"Researchers have discovered a banking trojan making waves in Brazil with an array of tricks up its sleeve, including using an unusual command and control (C&C) server. Researchers have discovered a banking trojan making waves in Brazil with an array of tricks up its sleeve, including using an unusual command and control (C&C) server and a full-screen social-engineering overlay form. Researchers at IBM X-Force research on Tuesday revealed that attackers are using the malware – dubbed MnuBot –mainly in Brazil to perform illegal transactions on victims’ open banking sessions. “MnuBot… has the same capabilities as most RATs,” Tomer Agayev, threat research team lead at IBM security, told Threatpost. “It allows the attacker to gain remote access to the infected machine, including displaying fake windows of various banks on the victim’s machine.” The remote access trojan (RAT) is unique in that it constantly queries the Microsoft SQL Database server for commands to be performed, giving attackers better dynamic configurations and anti-research capabilities. “Most malware in the wild today use a C&C server which is based on some form of a web server or an IRC channel,” Agayev wrote in a blog post. “In contrast, the MnuBot malware uses Microsoft SQL Server database server to communicate with the sample and send commands to be executed on the infected machine.” Once it has infected a system, MnuBot also uses a tricky social engineering method called a full-screen overlay form, which keeps the user waiting while the attacker commits the fraud. Overlay forms, similar to those used by many other malware families in the region, are used to prevent the victims from accessing their open banking session inside the browser. A pop-up appears, and meanwhile, in the background, the attacker takes control over the user endpoint and attempts to perform an illegal transaction via that open banking session. Agayev said that data about the scope of the malware campaign is not public: “MnuBot was discovered during active research of new Brazilian malwares, and… we can’t disclose any additional information about its methods,” he told Threatpost. Two-Stage Attack Flow The majority of Brazilian malware infects systems via malicious email, although X-Force is still examining the infection methods, Agayev told Threatpost. After this initial infection, MnuBot is built from two base components making up a two-stage attack flow, said researchers. In its first stage, MnuBot looks for a file called Desk.txt within the AppData Roaming folder, which places data from applications onto whatever machine the user happens to be logged in on. This enables MnuBot to know which desktop is currently running; the malware then constantly checks for a window name that is similar to one of the bank names in its configuration. Once it discovers one, it will query the server for the second stage executable according to the bank name that was found. The subsequent downloaded executable (C:\\Users\\Public\\Neon.exe) contains the meat of the attack by providing the attacker with full control over the victim’s machine, according to Agayev. This executable also gives attackers abilities like keylogging, taking screenshots of desktops, restarting the victim’s machines, creating a form to overlay the bank’s forms and stealing user data in the form. C&C Server MnuBot connects to the Microsoft SQL Database server in order to fetch the initial configuration by using SQL server details – such as server address, port, username and a password – which are hardcoded inside the sample. Attackers can dynamically change MnuBot’s malicious activity, and once the authors take down the server, it becomes almost impossible for a researcher to reverse engineer the malware sample behavior. “It is most likely that MnuBot authors wanted to try to evade regular AV detection, which is based on the malware traffic. To do so they tried to wrap their malicious network communication using seemingly innocent MS SQL traffic,” said researchers. Some of MnuBot’s tricks are typical traits of malware families in Brazil, researchers said. “MnuBot is an excellent example of many malware families in the Brazilian region,” said Agayev. “It holds many characteristics that are typical of other recently discovered malware strains. For example, the overlaying forms and the new desktop creation are well-known techniques that malware authors in the region use today.” : Malware Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1566 Phishing,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] Researchers have discovered a banking trojan making waves in Brazil with an array of tricks up its sleeve, including using an unusual command and control (C&C) server.

"U.S. regulators are warning banks about a recent rash of ATM fraud and the ongoing risks DDoS attacks targeting public websites can pose. U.S. regulators are warning banks this week about a recent rash of “large dollar value” ATM fraud and the ongoing risks distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that target public bank websites can pose. Members of FFIEC, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency sect of the U.S. government responsible for preparing banking standards and principles, issued the warnings in a statement yesterday. FFIEC claims attackers have been able to gain access to and alter the settings on web-based ATM control panels belonging to small to medium sized institutions.  The campaign, nicknamed “Unlimited Operations” by the U.S. Secret Service, is allowing attackers to withdraw money beyond controlled limits on ATMs, oftentimes more than the victim’s cash balance. FFIEC’s warning describes how exactly the control panels figure into the ATMs: “These control panels, often web-based, manage the amount of money customers may withdraw within a set time frame, the geographic limitations of withdrawals, the types and frequency of fraud reports that its service provider sends to the financial institutions, the designated employee that receives these reports, and other management functions related to card security and internal controls,” Officials are claiming hackers used phishing attacks to secure legitimate employee log-ins to tweak these settings to carry out their attacks, including one that netted them $40 million with 12 debit card accounts. FFIEC also used the announcement as an opportunity to remind banks about the continued sophistication surrounding DDoS attacks – pointing out a string of attacks that affected institutions in 2012 and warning that they can be used as a “diversionary tactic,” granting hackers the time to root around systems. Naturally, FFIEC is encouraging banks to mitigate further risk by following standards already in place such as PCI-DSS and HSM when it comes to encrypting PINs. The agency is also encouraging banks if they haven’t already, to formulate some sort of DDoS readiness plan with a program that prioritizes and assesses risks in its critical systems. “The members expect financial institutions to take steps to address this threat by reviewing the adequacy of their controls over their information technology networks,” the joint statement reads. We first learned about “Unlimited Operations” last spring after eight members of the cybercrime ring were indicted in Brooklyn. Associates in at least 26 countries helped the crew cash out fake credit cards at 140 different ATMs to the tune of $45 million – $2.8 in NYC – in just shy of 24 hours. According to a federal indictment unsealed last year the money was later spent on kickbacks such as luxury cars and Rolex watches. : Government Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1566 Phishing,T0814 Denial of Service","<s>[INST] U.S. regulators are warning banks about a recent rash of ATM fraud and the ongoing risks DDoS attacks targeting public websites can pose.

"Verizon is in the process of notifying 1.5 million customers of its Enterprise Solutions division that they’ve been breached. Verizon is in the process of notifying customers of its Enterprise Solutions division that their data has been breached. The news comes a few days after a treasure trove of information on 1.5 million Verizon Enterprise customers reportedly made its way onto an underground cybercrime forum, according to KrebsonSecurity.com, which broke the news on Thursday. The seller is apparently offering the information at a hefty cost; selling chunks of 100,000 records for $10,000, or the entire database for $100,000. Those interested can reportedly even purchase information about security vulnerabilities in Verizon’s site. Verizon said it fixed the vulnerability that led to the breach and is stressing that only basic contact information, such as names and email addresses, on customers has been exposed. “Verizon recently discovered and remediated a security vulnerability on our enterprise client portal,” the company said in a statement. “Our investigation to date found an attacker obtained basic contact information on a number of our enterprise customers. No customer proprietary network information or other data was accessed or accessible.” According to Krebs, the person selling the data is offering it in multiple formats, including MongoDB, something that’s led to speculation over whether or not MongoDB, a cross-platform document database, was hijacked in the process. Verizon’s Enterprise Solutions is a B2B arm of the company that helps manage its government and business clients, a list that includes 97 percent of the Fortune 500, according to its site. The company actually releases an annual report each April – the Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) – that usually chronicles threat patterns from year to year. Needless to say, while the irony around the breach has not been lost on experts, some are still wondering how the company could have been penetrated. Details are scant around how exactly Verizon was breached but Deral Heiland, Research Lead with Rapid7, is surmising that since the attackers are selling information about the vulnerabilities, it may have been a SQL, or other type of injection vulnerability. “If MongoDB was being used, this is known as a “NoSQL” database and traditional SQL injection attacks will not work, although NoSQL databases are still subject to injection attacks, which can be leveraged to extract data from the MongoDB,” Heiland said Friday. Others, like John Prisco, CEO of the endpoint security firm Triumfant, have gone for the jugular. “Ask yourself why the company that writes the annual DBIR has itself been breached? The answer is that the cyber companies receiving billions of dollars of funding are spending it on drive-time radio and other marketing hype; not enough on software development,” Prisco said, “It requires more than just the usual superficial understanding of one’s adversary to create an analytic cyber product capable of keeping up with the bad guys.” : Privacy Vulnerabilities",T1082 System Information Discovery,"<s>[INST] Verizon is in the process of notifying 1.5 million customers of its Enterprise Solutions division that they’ve been breached.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes Disruptions are often unforeseen. This could be a catastrophic event like a hurricane, a fire, or an earthquake. Disruptions, however, can also come in other forms such as that of a pandemic. This means that a building doesn’t necessarily have to be demolished or lives have to be lost for an unforeseen event to completely interrupt a company. We are witnessing this in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted the continuity of many businesses while forcing most of the workforce to work from home. The remote workforce poses new challenges for businesses as access to the relevant software and third-party platforms need to be ensured for business continuity. One company that realizes this and is making every effort to help employees work remotely and securely is FWP, a provider of contemporary IT and software solutions designed to help customers adapt to the ever-changing workplace. The Driving Force Behind FWP As businesses tackle the current COVID-19 crisis, executives must consider a series of challenges and take measures that not only allow them to respond to severe market shocks now but also aid recovery and better equip their company for the future. The logic behind business continuity planning is simple—any disruption in operations means loss of income/revenue for a business. If these missed earnings add up with increased costs, company profits go down. Moreover, business insurance can only cover the physical loss incurred due to disruption; it does not account for the customers lost to a competitor due to disruption in business operations. Realizing this, FWP looks to provide its customers with solutions that minimize the risk of disrupted business operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based in the UK, FWP Global LTD utilizes a highly experienced IT team to empower employees everywhere to work remotely and securely. The company specializes in providing customers with the latest solutions that are designed for end-user computing. Solutions and services offered by FWP include Software Asset Management, End Point Management, Environment Assessment and Analytics to Data Loss Prevention, Cyber Security, and Malware Detection. FWP looks to deliver excellence in the above by partnering with like-minded organizations that are focused on offering flexible and robust IT solutions. The Challenge That FWP Faced in Providing Customers with the Latest Solutions That Empower Their Employees to Work Remotely and Securely FWP has prioritized data loss prevention and endpoint protection of its increasing number of clients that are now working remotely. “Our focus is to provide comprehensive solutions based on the specific needs of the end-user. Lately, we’re seeing an increasing number of clients that are working remote due to COVID, and data loss prevention and endpoint protection is a top priority for employers and IT departments,” says Mark Adams, Managing Director at FWP Global. With the above goal in mind, the company set out to find a comprehensive endpoint protection solution. During its search, FWP came across many solutions, but none of them offered the ease of navigation the company was looking for. After a lot of research and failed trials, FWP was able to find what it was looking for—an endpoint protection solution that offered a single view and was easy to navigate. “The demand for a comprehensive endpoint protection solution drove us to expand into the security market. We looked at numerous solutions but Comodo offers a single view from the Dragon platform, which is easy to navigate,” revealed Adams. How FWP Is Making Life Easier for Customers and Employees FWP partnered with Comodo to provide customers with the latest solutions that empower their employees to work remotely and securely. FWP chose Comodo’s Dragon Platform with Advanced Endpoint Protection (AEP), which is a patent-pending auto containment technology with active breach protection that neutralizes ransomware, malware, and cyberattacks. Comodo’s AEP utilizes a Default Deny Platform to provide complete protection against zero-day threats while having no impact on end-user experience or workflows. Additionally, Comodo’s Valkyrie analyzes and gives a trusted verdict for 100% of files on a network. “The biggest benefit we’re enjoying since working with Comodo is that suspicious files are containerized, assessed, and easy to manage.” Comodo’s Valkyrie analyzes and gives a trusted verdict for every file–no other company will analyze and give a trusted verdict for 100% of the files on a network. “Plus, the collaboration with Comodo is fantastic; they provide us with world-class support,” says Adams. Final Word FWP is benefiting from Comodo’s unique approach to cybersecurity. Comodo’s platform shares intelligence and is, therefore, more secure than disparate products that claim the best of the breed but don’t share information. Comodo has architected its cyber-security product to maximize intelligent sharing between every component of the platform, therefore providing superior security. This shift from reactive to proactive is what makes Comodo unique with the capacity to protect all domains of business activity and threat—from network to web to cloud—with confidence and efficacy.

This could be a catastrophic event like a hurricane, a fire, or an earthquake. Disruptions, however, can also come in other forms such as that of a pandemic. This means that a building doesn’t necessarily have to be demolished or lives have to be lost for an unforeseen event to completely interrupt a company. We are witnessing this in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted the continuity of many businesses while forcing most of the workforce to work from home. The remote workforce poses new challenges for businesses as access to the relevant software and third-party platforms need to be ensured for business continuity. One company that realizes this and is making every effort to help employees work remotely and securely is FWP, a provider of contemporary IT and software solutions designed to help customers adapt to the ever-changing workplace. The Driving Force Behind FWP As businesses tackle the current COVID-19 crisis, executives must consider a series of challenges and take measures that not only allow them to respond to severe market shocks now but also aid recovery and better equip their company for the future. The logic behind business continuity planning is simple—any disruption in operations means loss of income/revenue for a business. If these missed earnings add up with increased costs, company profits go down. Moreover, business insurance can only cover the physical loss incurred due to disruption; it does not account for the customers lost to a competitor due to disruption in business operations. Realizing this, FWP looks to provide its customers with solutions that minimize the risk of disrupted business operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based in the UK, FWP Global LTD utilizes a highly experienced IT team to empower employees everywhere to work remotely and securely. The company specializes in providing customers with the latest solutions that are designed for end-user computing. Solutions and services offered by FWP include Software Asset Management, End Point Management, Environment Assessment and Analytics to Data Loss Prevention, Cyber Security, and Malware Detection.

"Malware laced OpenDocument files target Microsoft Office, OpenOffice and LibreOffice users. Attackers have a new obfuscation technique that uses the OpenDocument file format for sneaking payloads past antivirus software. Past macro-based attacks have relied on malware hitching a ride with .docx, .zip, .jar and many other file formats. But researchers at Cisco Talos said that because these attempts are nearly certain to be red flagged by endpoint protection, hackers are turning to the OpenDocument (ODT) format to avoid detection. “The use of the ODT file format shows that actors are happy to try out different mechanisms of infection, perhaps in an attempt to see if… these documents have a higher rate of infection or are better at avoiding detection,” wrote Cisco Talos researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres on Monday. They said some AV engines and system sandboxes do not handle these ODT file formats with the appropriate method so they become “missed” in some instances. “There have recently been multiple malware campaigns using this file type that are able to avoid antivirus detection, due to the fact that these engines view ODT files as standard archives and don’t apply the same rules it normally would for an Office document,” they wrote. Mercer and Rascagneres said because of this, “an attacker can use ODT files to deliver malware that would normally get blocked by traditional antivirus software.” In the documented cases where ODT files were used successfully in attacks the majority of the incidents involved Microsoft Office, while OpenOffice and LibreOffice were targeted to a lesser degree. Example Cases In one example highlighted by Cisco Talos, attackers used a malicious ODT file with an embedded Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) file. OLE files are used to embed or link documents together for sharing data across applications. Next, the ODT used the embedded OLE to trigger the HTML Application script (HTA) into action. The HTA script downloaded the remote administrative tool (RAT) called NJRAT. The attack scenario did involve the recipient of the malicious email to double-click the attachment and grant the document permission to run, while alerting the user the “file type can be unsafe.” Researchers also shared a second case study where the OLE object was similarly packed inside an ODT file and delivered malware. Like the previous example, user interaction is required. “The OLE execution writes ‘Spotify.exe’ to the victim machine, which is clearly not the legitimate Spotify platform executable. This .NET binary deflates a new binary stored as a resource. The new PE is a new binary packed with a multitude of different packers such as Goliath, babelfor.NET and 9rays,” said researchers. Once unpacked the final payload was the information stealer malware AZORult. To a lesser extent OpenOffice and LibreOffice were also targeted. “In this case, the attackers used the equivalent of macros in Microsoft Office documents in the StarOffice Basic open-source software. StarOffice Basic’s code is located in the Basic/Standard/ repository inside the ODT archive,” researchers wrote. In that case, researchers said the ODT document ultimately appeared to be designed to download Metasploit payloads.

"Browsers Firefox and Edge take a beating on day two of the Pwn2Own competition. Hackers took down the Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge browsers on Thursday at Pwn2Own, the annual hacking conference held in tandem with CanSecWest, as the competition continued for a second day. The dynamic hacking duo of Amat Cama and Richard Zhu, which make up team Fluoroacetate, had another good day, following Wednesday’s successes. The two trained their skills first on Mozilla Firefox, leveraging a JIT bug in the browser, followed up by an out-of-bounds write exploit in the Windows kernel. The one-two punch allowed Fluoroacetate to take over the targeted system. “They were able to execute code at SYSTEM level just by using Firefox to visit their specially crafted website,” wrote Zero Day Initiative in a write-up of the day’s hacking results. For their efforts the two earned $50,000. The story of the day continued to be Cama and Zhu, who earned an additional $130,000 for a “masterfully crafted exploit chain” that eventually lead to the owning the underlying hypervisor of a VMware Workstation, ZDI reported. That hack began on VMware Workstation where Fluoroacetate opened an Edge browser and visited a booby-trapped website that contained a confusion bug. Next, Cama and Zhu used a race condition in the Windows kernel followed by an out-of-bounds write in VMware workstation that linked to executing code on the underlying hypervisor. Arthur Gerkis of Exodus Intelligence Adding both day’s awards together, Fluoroacetate has so far earned $340,000 in the Pwn2Own competition this year. Mozilla’s Firefox browser went down a second time Thursday, thanks to hacker Niklas Baumstark. He was able to execute code at the system level of a PC by leveraging a JIT bug in Firefox. “In a real-world scenario, an attacker could use this to run their code on a target system at the level of the logged-on user,” ZDI wrote. The successful exploit earned Baumstark $40,000. A researcher named Arthur Gerkis, with Exodus Intelligence, was the final contestant and a newcomer to the Pwn2Own competition. His target was also Microsoft’s Edge browser. “[Gerkis] wasted no time by using a double free bug in the renderer followed by a logic bug to bypass the sandbox,” ZDI wrote.

"The distributed computing vendor patched the flaw, affecting Citrix ADC and Gateway, along with another flaw impacting availability for SD-WAN appliances. A critical security bug in the Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway could allow cyberattackers to crash entire corporate networks without needing to authenticate. The two affected Citrix products (formerly the NetScaler ADC and Gateway) are used for application-aware traffic management and secure remote access, respectively. The federated working specialist pushed out a security patch on Tuesday for the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22955, which allows unauthenticated denial of service (DoS), due to uncontrolled resource consumption, according to the advisory. Citrix also addressed a lower-severity bug that is likewise due to uncontrolled resource consumption. It impacts both previous products, as well as the Citrix SD-WAN WANOP Edition appliance. The latter provides optimization for Citrix SD-WAN deployments, which enable secure connectivity and seamless access to virtual, cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps across enterprise and branch locations. Register now for our LIVE event! Tracked as CVE-2021-22956, the second flaw allows temporary disruption of: a device’s management GUI; the Nitro API for configuring and monitoring NetScaler appliances programmatically; and remote procedure call (RPC) communication, which is what essentially enables distributed computing in Citrix settings. In terms of the impact of exploitation, all three products are widely deployed globally, with Gateway and ADC alone installed in at least 80,000 companies in 158 countries as of early 2020, according to an assessment from Positive Technologies at the time. Disruption to any of the appliances could prevent remote and branch access to corporate resources and general blocking of cloud and virtual assets and apps. All of this makes them an attractive target for cybercriminals, and indeed, the Citrix ADC and Gateway in particular are no spring chickens when it comes to the critical vulnerability scene. In the summer of 2020, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered that would allow code injection, information disclosure and denial of service, with many exploitable by an unauthenticated, remote attacker. And, in December of 2019, a critical RCE bug was disclosed as a zero-day that took the vendor weeks to patch. Few Technical Details, Many Affected Products While Citrix didn’t release technical details on the latest bugs, VulnDB noted on Wednesday that for CVE-2021-22955, “the exploitability is told to be difficult. The attack can only be initiated within the local network. The exploitation doesn’t require any form of authentication.” It assigned a severity score of 5.1 out of 10 to the bug, despite Citrix’ internal rating of “critical.” The site also reported that exploits are calculated to be worth up to $5,000, and noted that “manipulation with an unknown input leads to a denial of service vulnerability…This is going to have an impact on availability.” The vendor said the vulnerabilities affect the following supported versions: Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2021-22955 and CVE-2021-22956): Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-83.27 Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1 before 12.1-63.22 Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1 before 11.1-65.23 Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.257 Citrix SD-WAN WANOP Edition (CVE-2021-22956): Models 4000-WO, 4100-WO, 5000-WO and 5100-WO Version 11.4 before 11.4.2 Version 10.2 before 10.2.9c The WANOP feature of SD-WAN Premium Edition is not impacted. In the case of the first Citrix ADC and Gateway bug, appliances must be configured as a VPN or AAA virtual server in order to be vulnerable.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes  Between Flash and PDF Reader alone, Adobe is ubiquitous on today’s desktop. Have you ever registered for an Adobe product? If you have, you should seriously consider changing your password. If you are like most people, who use similar passwords and usernames across their personal account, you might consider changing all of your passwords.On October 3rd, Adobe announced that they were the victims of one of the most significant data breaches in history. Personal data for nearly 2.9 million of their customers had been stolen, including credit card data. That alone put it in the hall of fame of breaches.But it gets worse. Yesterday, Adobe announced that an additional 35 million customer data records were included in the breach. They hastened to add that these records do not include credit card data, but personal information that includes user names and passwords can be a goldmine to hackers. The passwords were encrypted, but that is usually not enough to stop determined hackers. Adobe reset all current passwords and published a security alert with help for effected customers. They wisely advise customer’s to update their passwords to one that they have not used before and to beware of phishing email scams that pretend to be a reset message from Adobe. Such scams trick victims into revealing their user names and passwords by taking them to a fake web site that looks like the real company and its login or password reset page. It is very important to understand this is not just about access to your account with Adobe. Increasingly, hackers are taking a highly targeted approach to their attacks. Borrowing from the techniques of “Advanced Persistent Threats” pioneered by nation states, hackers will target very specific individuals to gain access to their organization’s network or to dupe into a financial fraud. The information stolen from Adobe can be a gold mine for APT attacks. Many, if not most people reuse the same user names and passwords, often with a pattern for varying passwords when they require a change. The bad guys may just be able to derive you online bank login based on your Adobe account credentials. The Adobe security alert leaves off another aspect of the breach that is also quite troubling. Hackers, presumably part of the same operation, also stole the source code for several of Adobe’s major products, including PDF viewer and Photoshop. Why would hackers want source code and why should I care? I’m glad you asked me that! Hackers can use the source code for two purposes. With some products, most prominently Adobe Flash, hackers look for vulnerabilities in the software that they can exploit to spread Trojan viruses Trojans and take over computer. They can also use the source code to spread faux versions of the software that are in fact. One final thought on this mess. Companies like Adobe work hard to protect their networks and their data, so breaches are relatively rate. However, when they occur they are bad. Very bad. Consider this: In a paper based world it would take a large store room filled with dozens of filing cabinets. It would be tough to sneak out the door with all of that data. You would need a truck to move it all. However, the stolen file was a “mere” 3.8GB, easily copied using a USB thumb drive! This means that no matter how hard organizations work to shut the door on hackers, the hackers will work even harder. If they can pry that door open, they drive a truck through it!

"PDF versionIn July we published our in-depth analysis into a targeted attack campaign that we dubbed ‘Crouching Yeti’. This campaign is also known as ‘Energetic Bear’.This campaign, which has been active since late 2010, has so far targeted the following sectors: industrial/machinery, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, construction, education and information technology. So far there have been more than 2,800 victims worldwide, and we have been able to identify 101 different organisations – mostly in the United States, Spain, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, Poland and China.The list of victims suggests that the attackers behind Crouching Yeti are pursuing strategic targets.  Nevertheless, the attackers have also shown an interest in not-so-obvious institutions too.The attackers behind Crouching Yeti use various types of malware (all designed to infect systems running Windows) to infiltrate their victims, extend their reach within the target organisations and steal confidential data, including intellectual property and other strategic information.  Infected computers connect to a large network of hacked web sites that host malware modules, hold information about victims and send commands to infected systems.The attackers use three methods to infect their victims.  First, they use a legitimate software installer, re-packaged to include a malicious DLL file.  Such modified self-extracting archive files could be uploaded directly to a compromised server, or they could be sent directly to someone within the target organisation by e-mail.  Second, they use spear-phishing to deliver a malicious XDP (XML Data Package) file containing a Flash exploit (CVE-2011-0611).  Third, they use watering-hole attacks.  Hacked web sites use several exploits (CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-1347, and CVE-2012-1723) to redirect visitors to malicious JAR or HTML files hosted on other sites maintained by the attackers.  The term ‘watering-hole’ is applied to a web site that is likely to be visited by potential victims.  These web sites are compromised in advance by the attackers – the site is injected to install malware on the computers of anyone visiting the compromised site.One malicious program used by the attackers, the Havex Trojan, includes special modules to collect data from specific industrial IT environments.  The first of these is the OPC scanner module. This module is designed to collect the extremely detailed data about the OPC servers running in the local network. OPC (Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control) servers are typically used where multiple industrial automation systems are operating.  This module is accompanied by a network scanning tool.  This module scans the local network, looks for all computers listening on ports related to OPC/SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software, and tries to connect to such hosts in order to identify which potential OPC/SCADA system is running. It then transmits all the data it finds to the Command-and-Control (C2) servers used by the attackers to manage the campaign.While analysing the code, we looked for clues that might point to the identity of the attackers.A timestamp analysis of 154 files revealed that most of the samples were compiled between 06:00 and 16:00 UTC.  This could match any country in Europe.  We also looked at the language used by the attackers.  The malware contains strings in English (written by non-native English speakers).  There were also some clues pointing indicating possible French and Swedish speaker.  But unlike several other researchers who looked at Crouching Yeti, we didn’t find anything that would enable us to conclude with certainty that the attackers are of Russian origin.  There’s a lack of Cyrillic content (or transliteration) across the 200 malicious binaries and related operational content – in contrast to what we found when looking at earlier targeted attack campaigns, including Red October, MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, the Snake and TeamSpy.For more than a year Kaspersky Lab has been researching a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign that we call ‘Epic Turla’.  This campaign, which dates back to 2012, targets government institutions, embassies, military, research and educational organizations and pharmaceutical companies. Most of the victims are located in the Middle East and Europe, although we have seen victims elsewhere, including the United States. Altogether, we have found several hundred victim’s IP addresses in more than 45 countries.When we published our initial research into this campaign, it was unclear how victims of the attack were becoming infected. In in our latest research, published in August, we outlined the infection mechanisms used by Epic Turla and how they fit within the structure of the overall campaign.The attackers use social engineering tricks to infect their victims –specifically spear-phishing and watering-hole attacks.Some of the spear-phishing e-mails include zero-day exploits. The first of these, affecting Adobe Acrobat Reader (CVE-2013-3346), allows the attackers to arbitrarily execute code on the victim’s computer. The second, a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 (CVE-2013-5065), provides the Epic Turla backdoor with administrator rights on the victim’s computer. In addition, the attackers trick their victims into running malware installers with an SCR extension – sometimes packed using RAR.  When the unsuspecting victims open an infected file, a backdoor is installed on their computer, giving the attackers full control.The cybercriminals behind Epic Turla also use watering-hole attacks that deploy a Java exploit (CVE-2012-1723), Adobe Flash exploits and Internet Explorer exploits. There are others that use social engineering to trick victims into running fake ‘Flash Player’ malware installers.  Depending on the IP address of the victim, the attackers serve Java or browser exploits, signed fake Adobe Flash Player software or a fake version of Microsoft Security Essentials. We have seen more than 100 injected web sites. Unsurprisingly, the choice of web sites reflects the specific interests of the attackers (as well as the interests of the victims). For example, many infected Spanish web sites belong to local governments.Once the computer is infected, the Epic Turla backdoor (known also as ‘WorldCupSec’, ‘TadjMakhal’, ‘Wipbot’ and ‘Tadvig’) immediately connects to the C2 server to send a pack containing the victim’s system information.   Based on the summary information sent to the C2 server, the attackers deliver pre-configured batch files containing a series of commands to be executed on the infected computer.   The attackers also upload custom lateral movement tools (including a specific keylogger and RAR archiver), as well as standard utilities such as a DNS query tool from Microsoft.Our analysis revealed that the Epic Turla backdoor is just the first stage of a wider infection process.  It is used to deploy a more sophisticated backdoor known as the ‘Cobra/Carbon system’ (named ‘Pfinet’ by some anti-malware products).  After some time, the attackers went further, using the Epic Turla implant to update the Carbon configuration file with a different set of C2 servers.  The unique knowledge to operate these two backdoors indicates a clear and direct connection between them:  one is used to gain a foothold and validate the high-profile victim.  If the victim proves to be of interest to the attackers, the compromised computer is upgraded to the full Carbon system.Here’s an overview of the whole Epic Turla cyber-espionage campaign:Attributing these attacks is always very difficult.  However, some aspects of the code tell us something about the attackers.  It’s clear that they are not native English speakers.  They commonly misspell words and phrases, such as:‘Password it’s wrong!’ ‘File is not exists’ ‘File is exists for edit’There are also other indicators that hint at the origin of the attackers.  For example, some of the backdoors have been compiled on a system with the Russian language.  In addition, the internal name of one of the Epic Turla backdoors is ‘Zagruzchik.dll’, which means ‘bootloader’ or ‘load program’ in Russian.  Finally, the Epic Turla ‘mother ship’ control panel sets the code page to 1251, which is used for Cyrillic characters.We have discussed this targeted attack campaign, which has now been active for 10 years, on several occasions.Earlier this year we observed an increase in the number of attacks on Uyghur and Tibetan activists, using an updated version of the NetTraveler backdoor.  The attackers use spear-phishing e-mails to lure their victims:  e-mails include a Microsoft Word document that contains the CVE-2012-0158 exploit.  This drops the main module (‘net.exe’) onto the computer, which in turn installs a number of other files, including the main C2 module.  This module is registered as a service (‘Windowsupdata’) by means of a Windows batch file called ‘dot.bat’.  The format of the malware configuration file has also been updated and it’s clear that the attackers have taken steps to try and conceal the configuration (but the encryption they used is weak).The focus of the attackers has changed over time.  For much of its existence, the main targets of NetTraveler were diplomatic, government and military organisations.  More recently, its cyber-espionage activities have focused more on organisations involved in space exploration, nano-technology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine and communications.A focus on Uyghur and Tibetan activists remains a core part of the attackers’ activities.Technology is now an integral part of our lives, so it’s hardly surprising to see a cyber-dimension to conflicts around the world.  This is especially true of the Middle East, where geo-political conflicts have intensified in recent years.  Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team  analysed the recent increase in malware activity in Syria.The people behind these attacks use social engineering tricks to lure their victims into opening infected files. They use e-mail, Skype messages, Facebook posts and YouTube videos.They use a variety of ‘hooks’ – preying on their victims’ trust in social networking forums, their curiosity about news related to the conflict in Syria, their fear of the government and their lack of technical awareness.Examples include a disturbing video on YouTube showing injured victims of recent bombings that also invites people to download a malicious program from a public file-sharing web site. We also found a set of compressed files on a popular social networking site which, when extracted, revealed a database containing a list of activists and wanted individuals in Syria. The download link for this database application was included in the information section of a video published on 9 November 2013. The attackers also make use of fake security solutions to trick their victims – including a fake anti-virus program called ‘Ammazon Internet Security’ and a Trojanised version of a legitimate network monitoring tool, Total Network Monitor. They don’t just spread fake security applications – we’ve also seen fake versions of the Whatsapp and Viber instant messaging apps.The attackers use a number of well-known remote administration tools (RATs), malicious programs that allow a remote ‘operator’ to control a compromised computer as if they had physical access to it.  These tools are widely used in cybercrime attacks of all kinds and even in some state-sponsored attacks.  The RATs used in this campaign include ‘ShadowTech’, ‘Xtreme’, ‘NjRAT’,’ Bitcoment’, ‘Dark Comet’ and ‘Blackshades’.  The malware is used to monitor the victims, to gather information and, in some cases, to try and shut down their operations.The victims of these attacks are not only located in Syria.  The attacks have also been seen in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Morocco, France and the United States.We were able to track the C2 servers of the attackers to IP addresses in Syria, Russia, Lebanon, the United States and Brazil.  In total, we found 110 files, 20 domains and 47 IP addresses associated with the attacks.The number of attacks has grown markedly over the last year.  In addition, it’s clear that the groups involved in the attacks are well organised.  So far the attackers have made use of established malware tools rather than developing their own (although they use a variety of obfuscation methods to bypass simple signature-based detection).  However, we think it’s likely that the number and sophistication of malware used in the region is likely to increase.You can find our full report on this malware here.Earlier this year Kaspersky Lab contributed to an alliance of law enforcement and industry organizations, co-ordinated by the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), to disrupt the infrastructure behind the Shylock Trojan.  This partnership shows how global cooperation on cybercrime can produce positive results.The Shylock banking Trojan, so-called because its code contains excerpts from Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, was first discovered in 2011.  Like other well-known banking Trojans such as Zeus, SpyEye and Carberp, Shylock is a man-in-the-browser attack designed to steal banking login credentials from the computers of bank customers.  The Trojan uses a pre-configured list of target banks, located in different countries around the world.The Trojan injects fake data entry fields into web pages when they load on the victim’s browser.  Victims are typically tricked into running the malware by clicking on malicious links.  Shylock then seeks to access funds held in business or personal bank accounts, and transfers them to accounts under the control of the attackers.The focus of the cybercriminals changed over time.  When Shylock first appeared, it was aimed mainly at victims in the UK and, during the course of 2012, spread to other countries in Europe and to the United States.  By the end of 2013, the cybercriminals were more focused on developing markets such as Brazil, Russia and Vietnam.  You can find more information, including data on the spread of the malware, here.All banking Trojans, Shylock included, target bank customers, hoping to take advantage of what is often the least protected element of any financial transaction – i.e. the human.  That’s why it’s important that security starts at home – we all need to secure our computers effectively.The number of ransomware programs has been growing in recent years – not all of them focused on computers running Windows.  Some, including the ones targeting Android devices, tend to simply block access to the device and demand a ransom payment in order to unlock the device.But many ransomware programs go further than this, encrypting data on the victim’s computer.  One recent example is ZeroLocker.Unlike most ransomware programs, which encrypt a pre-defined list of file types, ZeroLocker encrypts nearly all the files on the victim’s computer and adds the extension ‘.encrypt’ to encrypted files.  ZeroLocker doesn’t encrypt files located in directories containing the words ‘Windows’, ‘WINDOWS’, ‘Program Files’, ‘ZeroLocker’ or ‘Destroy’ and doesn’t encrypt files larger than 20MB in size.ZeroLocker generates a 160-bit AES key to encrypt all files.  The key space is somewhat limited because of the way the key is generated, but it’s still large enough to make general brute –forcing unfeasible.  After encrypting files, the malware runs the ‘cipher.exe’ utility to remove all unused data from the drive, making file recovery much more difficult.  The encryption key, together with a CRC32 of the computer’s MAC address, and the associated Bitcoin wallet, is sent to the server used by the cybercriminals.  There’s an indication that the C2 configuration contains some errors that might prevent successful decryption – another reason why paying the ransom is a bad idea.The encryption key, along with other information, is sent by means of a GET request, rather than a POST.  This results in a 404 error on the server.  This could mean that the server isn’t storing the information, suggesting that the victims will probably not get their files back, even if they pay the ransom.Several other URLs that the malware tries to get also result in 404 errors.  This suggests that the operation may still be in its infancy.  If and when these errors are fixed, we may see ZeroLocker deployed on a larger scale.The cybercriminals behind ZeroLocker demand an initial $300 worth of Bitcoins to decrypt the file.  If the victim does not pay promptly the fee increases to $500 and $1,000 as time goes on.There’s a Bitcoin wallet hard-coded inside the binary, but the malware tries to fetch a new wallet address from the C2 server, probably to make it harder to trace how successful the operation is and where the money goes.  None of the Bitcoin wallet addresses we looked at had any transactions associated with them.  Since the C2 server provides Bitcoin wallet information, it’s possible that the attackers are able to use a unique wallet for each victim.Another ransomware program that we analysed recently is Onion.  This malicious program uses the tried-and-tested method used by other recent ransomware programs – encrypting the victim’s data and demanding a ransom payment in Bitcoin.However, it also breaks new ground.  First, Onion uses the anonymous Tor network to hide its C2 servers.  This makes it harder to track down the cybercriminals behind the malware.  Other malware has used Tor in the past, but this Trojan stands apart because it supports full interaction with Tor without any input from the victim.  Other programs like this communicate with the Tor network by launching (sometimes by injecting code into other processes) the legitimate ‘tor.exe’ file.  By contrast Onion implements this communication as part of the malware code itself.Onion also uses an unorthodox cryptographic algorithm that makes file decryption impossible, even if traffic between the Trojan and the C2 server is intercepted.  This Trojan not only uses asymmetric encryption, it also uses a cryptographic protocol known as ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).  This makes decryption impossible without the master private key – which never leaves the cybercriminals’ controlled server.  Further details can be found in our report on the Onion Trojan.These things combined make the Onion Trojan technically advance and very dangerous.Ransomware operations rely on their victims paying up.  Don’t do it!  Instead, make regular backups of your data.  That way, if you ever fall victim to a ransomware program (or a hardware problem that stops you accessing your files) you will not lose any of your data.The Internet is becoming woven into the fabric of our lives – literally, in some cases, as connectivity is embedded into everyday objects.  This trend, known as the ‘Internet of Things’, has attracted more and more attention as hackers and researchers probe the technologies integrated into cars, hotels, home alarm systems and refrigerators and more – looking for vulnerabilities.Sometimes the Internet of things can seem remote. But it’s often closer than we think.  The modern home today is likely to have a handful of devices connected to the local network that aren’t traditional computers, tablets or cellphones – devices such as a smart TV, a printer, a gaming console, a network storage device or some kind of media player/satellite receiver.One of our security researchers, David Jacoby, investigated his own home, to determine whether it was really cyber-secure.  He looked at several devices, including network-attached storage (NAS) devices, smart TV, router and satellite receiver, to see if they were vulnerable to attack.  The results were striking.  David found 14 vulnerabilities in the network-attached storage devices, one in the smart TV and several potentially hidden remote control functions in the router.The most severe vulnerabilities were found in the network-attached storage devices.  Several of them would allow an attacker to remotely execute system commands with the highest administrative privileges.  The tested devices also had weak default passwords, stored passwords in plain text and included configuration files with the wrong permissions.  The default administrator password for one of the devices contained just one digit!  And another device even shared the entire configuration file, containing encrypted passwords, with everyone on the network!David was also able to upload a file to an area of storage memory that’s inaccessible to an ordinary user.  If an attacker uploaded a malicious file to this area, the compromised device would become a source of infection for other devices connecting to this NAS – a home PC, for example – and could even serve as a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) bot in a botnet. On top of this, the only way to delete this file was by using the same vulnerability –even for a technical specialist this is no simple task.When David looked at his smart TV, he discovered that communication between the TV and the TV vendor’s servers isn’t encrypted – potentially opening the way for a Man-in-the-Middle attack that could result in an unsuspecting consumer transferring money to fraudsters while trying to buy content via the TV.  As a proof of concept exercise, David was able to replace one of the icons on the smart TV graphic interface with a picture.  Normally the widgets and thumbnails are downloaded from the TV vendor’s servers but since the connection isn’t encrypted, this information could be modified by a third party.  He also discovered that the smart TV is able to execute Java code that, in combination with the ability to intercept the exchange of traffic between the TV and Internet, could result in exploit-driven malicious attacks.The DSL router, used to provide wireless Internet access for all other home devices, contained several dangerous features hidden from its owner.  Some of these hidden functions could potentially give an attacker remote access to any device in a private network.  What’s more, sections of the router’s web interface called ‘Web Cameras’, ‘Telephony Expert Configure’, ‘Access Control’, ‘WAN-Sensing’ and ‘Update’ are ‘invisible’ and cannot be adjusted by the owner of the device.  They can only be accessed by exploiting a rather generic vulnerability that makes it possible to travel between sections of the interface (these are basically web pages, each with its own alphanumeric address) by brute-forcing the numbers at the end of the address.  Originally these functions were implemented for the convenience of the owner of the device:  the remote access function makes it fast and easy for an ISP (Internet Service Provider) to troubleshoot and resolve technical problems on the device.  But this convenient feature could become a security risk if the controls fell into the wrong hands.In line with our policy of responsible disclosure, Kaspersky Lab hasn’t disclosed the names of vendors whose products were investigated as part of this research.  All vendors were informed about the existence of the vulnerabilities and Kaspersky Lab specialists work closely with vendors to help them remediate any vulnerabilities discovered.It’s important that we all understand the potential risks associated with using network devices – this applies to individuals and businesses alike.  We also need to understand that our information is not secure just because we use strong passwords or run software to protect against malicious code.  There are many things over which we have no control, and to some degree we are in the hands of software and hardware vendors.   For example, not all devices include automated update checks – sometimes consumers are required to download and install new firmware.  This is not always an easy task.  Worse still, it’s not always possible to update a device (most devices investigated during this research had been discontinued more than a year before).You can find some advice on how to reduce the risk of attack in this summary of David Jacoby’s article.In September, the information security world faced a red alert following the discovery of the ‘Bash’ vulnerability (also known as ‘ShellShock’). Bash, a Unix shell written in 1989, is the default shell on Linux and Mac OS X. The flaw (CVE-2014-6271) allows an attacker to remotely attach a malicious file to a variable that is executed when the Bash command interpreter is invoked. The high impact of this vulnerability, coupled with the ease with which it can be exploited, make it very powerful.  Some have compared it to the ‘Heartbleed’ vulnerability. However, Bash is much easier to exploit than Heartbleed and, whereas Heartbleed only allowed an attacker to steal data from the memory of a vulnerable computer, Shellshock could provide full system control.It didn’t take long for attackers to try and take advantage of the vulnerability – we discussed some early examples soon after it was discovered. In most cases attackers remotely attacked web servers hosting CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts that have been written in Bash or pass values to shell scripts. However, it is possible that the vulnerability could have an impact on a Windows-based infrastructure.Nor is the problem confined only to web servers. Bash is widely used in the firmware of devices that now take for granted in our everyday lives. This includes routers, home appliances and wireless access points. Some of these devices can be difficult, or impossible to patch – as discussed above.You can find guidance on how to update vulnerable systems here.All statistics used in this report were obtained using Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), a distributed antivirus network that works with various anti-malware protection components. The data was collected from KSN users who agreed to transfer it. Millions of Kaspersky Lab products users from 213 countries and territories worldwide participate in this global exchange of information about malicious activity.In Q3 2014 Kaspersky Lab mobile security products detected 74,489 new malicious mobile programs, 14.4% more than in the second quarter.At the same time, fewer installation packages were detected.Number of installation packages and new malicious mobile programs detected in Q1-Q3 2014In the first half of 2014, there were a little more than 11 malicious installation packages on the average associated with each malicious program but in Q3 there were 6.2 million.Using multiple installation packages for one mobile malicious program is typical of SMS-Trojan distributors. For example, attackers have used up to 70,000 packets for one version of Stealer.a. The decrease in the number of malicious installation packages is probably related to the reduced proportion of this malware in the flow of new mobile malicious programs decreased (see below).Distribution of mobile threats by type in Q2 and Q3 2014The rating of malware objects for mobile devices for the third quarter of 2014 was headed by RiskTool. This claimed 26.5% of detections, a rise of 8.6 percentage points. These are legal applications that are potentially dangerous for the user – if they are used carelessly, or manipulated by a cybercriminal they could lead to financial losses.Second came Adware, potentially unwanted advertising applications (19.4%); their contribution went down 7.9 pp.SMS-Trojans were in 3rd place: their share declined by 7.2pp from the previous quarter.In Q3, while Adware and SMS-Trojans were less widely seen, we observed a sharp rise in the percentage of banking Trojans: their share in the flow of mobile malware has risen from 2.2% to 9.2% which placed this category 4th in the rating.*The percentage of all attacks recorded on the mobile devices of unique users.The top 20 is no longer so heavily dominated by SMS Trojans: in Q2 2014 these malicious programs occupied 15 places in the rating while in Q3 there were only 8. Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Stealer.a  topped the previous quarter’s rating with 25.42% of all attacks but in Q3 it accounted for only 16.63% of attacks.RiskTool representatives occupied 6 positions in the Top 20, with RiskTool.AndroidOS.SMSreg.gc (14.17%) in second place.7th came  DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (3.94%), demonstrating how new malicious applications are detected by Kaspersky Security Network cloud technologies that enable our product to quickly respond to new unknown threats.In the third quarter, we detected 7010 mobile banking Trojans, 3.4 times more than last quarter.Number of mobile banking Trojans detected, Q1-Q3 2014The number of countries attacked by banking Trojans also increased: in Q2 mobile banking Trojan attacks were detected in 31 countries while in Q3 there were 70.The geography of mobile banking threats, Q3 2014 (the number of attacked users)The top 10 countries attacked by banking Trojans* The percentage of users attacked per countryItaly dropped out of the Top 10 while Saudi Arabia appeared in 10th place.Russia maintained its traditional lead here, although it was 7.85pp on before. At the same time the contribution of the other Top 10 members grew slightly: mobile cybercriminals are gradually extending their area of activity.In Q3 2014 mobile malicious attacks were detected at least once in 205 countries.The geography of infection by mobile banking Trojans, Q3 2014 (the percentage of all attacked users)The Top 10 of attacked countries* The percentage of users attacked per countryRussia remained the most heavily targeted nation with 44% of all attacks. India (7.6%) returned to second place. For the first time in 2014 Iran (3.4%) and the USA (1.7%) entered the Top 10 while Poland, France, Spain and Mexico were the Q3 outsiders.The rating of vulnerable applications below is based on information about the exploits blocked by our products. These exploits were used by hackers in Internet attacks and when compromising local applications, including those installed on mobile devices.The distribution of web-exploits used by fraudsters, by type of application attacked, Q3 2014Of all registered attempts to use vulnerabilities, 47% involved vulnerabilities in browsers. Almost every exploit pack includes an exploit for Internet Explorer.Java exploits are in second place. Java vulnerabilities are used in drive-by attacks via the Internet and new Java exploits are part of many exploit packs although no new Java vulnerabilities have been made public for almost a year. In Q3 of this year, 28% of attempts to use vulnerabilities targeted Java; in the first quarter the figure was 29%.Next come Adobe Reader exploits (12%). These vulnerabilities are also exploited in drive-by attacks via the Internet and PDF exploits feature in many exploit packs.The statistics in this section were derived from web antivirus components that protect users when malicious code attempts to download from a malicious/infected website. Malicious websites are deliberately created by malicious users; infected sites include those with user-contributed content (such as forums) as well as legitimate resources that have been hacked.During the reporting period, Kaspersky Lab solutions blocked 696,977 attacks that attempted to launch malware capable of stealing money from online banking accounts. This figure represents a 24.9% decrease compared to Q2 (927,568).The number of computers attacked by financial malware, Q3 2014The number of attacks gradually declined throughout the quarter: in June 244,490 attacks were blocked while in September this figure was 218,384 (-11%).A total of 2,466,952 notifications of malicious activity by programs designed to steal money via online access to bank accounts were registered by Kaspersky Lab security solutions in Q3 2014.The geography of banking malware attacks in Q2 2014 (by number of attacked users in the country)The Top 10 countries by the number of attacked users:Brazil remained the country where users are most often attacked by banking malware, even if its share was down one third.

This campaign is also known as ‘Energetic Bear’.This campaign, which has been active since late 2010, has so far targeted the following sectors: industrial/machinery, manufacturing, pharmaceutical, construction, education and information technology. So far there have been more than 2,800 victims worldwide, and we have been able to identify 101 different organisations – mostly in the United States, Spain, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, Poland and China.The list of victims suggests that the attackers behind Crouching Yeti are pursuing strategic targets.  Nevertheless, the attackers have also shown an interest in not-so-obvious institutions too.The attackers behind Crouching Yeti use various types of malware (all designed to infect systems running Windows) to infiltrate their victims, extend their reach within the target organisations and steal confidential data, including intellectual property and other strategic information.  Infected computers connect to a large network of hacked web sites that host malware modules, hold information about victims and send commands to infected systems.The attackers use three methods to infect their victims.  First, they use a legitimate software installer, re-packaged to include a malicious DLL file.  Such modified self-extracting archive files could be uploaded directly to a compromised server, or they could be sent directly to someone within the target organisation by e-mail.  Second, they use spear-phishing to deliver a malicious XDP (XML Data Package) file containing a Flash exploit (CVE-2011-0611).  Third, they use watering-hole attacks.  Hacked web sites use several exploits (CVE-2013-2465, CVE-2013-1347, and CVE-2012-1723) to redirect visitors to malicious JAR or HTML files hosted on other sites maintained by the attackers.  The term ‘watering-hole’ is applied to a web site that is likely to be visited by potential victims.  These web sites are compromised in advance by the attackers – the site is injected to install malware on the computers of anyone visiting the compromised site.One malicious program used by the attackers, the Havex Trojan, includes special modules to collect data from specific industrial IT environments.  The first of these is the OPC scanner module. This module is designed to collect the extremely detailed data about the OPC servers running in the local network. OPC (Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) for Process Control) servers are typically used where multiple industrial automation systems are operating.  This module is accompanied by a network scanning tool.  This module scans the local network, looks for all computers listening on ports related to OPC/SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) software, and tries to connect to such hosts in order to identify which potential OPC/SCADA system is running. It then transmits all the data it finds to the Command-and-Control (C2) servers used by the attackers to manage the campaign.While analysing the code, we looked for clues that might point to the identity of the attackers.A timestamp analysis of 154 files revealed that most of the samples were compiled between 06:00 and 16:00 UTC.  This could match any country in Europe.  We also looked at the language used by the attackers.  The malware contains strings in English (written by non-native English speakers).  There were also some clues pointing indicating possible French and Swedish speaker.  But unlike several other researchers who looked at Crouching Yeti, we didn’t find anything that would enable us to conclude with certainty that the attackers are of Russian origin.  There’s a lack of Cyrillic content (or transliteration) across the 200 malicious binaries and related operational content – in contrast to what we found when looking at earlier targeted attack campaigns, including Red October, MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, the Snake and TeamSpy.For more than a year Kaspersky Lab has been researching a sophisticated cyber-espionage campaign that we call ‘Epic Turla’.  This campaign, which dates back to 2012, targets government institutions, embassies, military, research and educational organizations and pharmaceutical companies. Most of the victims are located in the Middle East and Europe, although we have seen victims elsewhere, including the United States. Altogether, we have found several hundred victim’s IP addresses in more than 45 countries.When we published our initial research into this campaign, it was unclear how victims of the attack were becoming infected. In in our latest research, published in August, we outlined the infection mechanisms used by Epic Turla and how they fit within the structure of the overall campaign.The attackers use social engineering tricks to infect their victims –specifically spear-phishing and watering-hole attacks.Some of the spear-phishing e-mails include zero-day exploits. The first of these, affecting Adobe Acrobat Reader (CVE-2013-3346), allows the attackers to arbitrarily execute code on the victim’s computer. The second, a privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 (CVE-2013-5065), provides the Epic Turla backdoor with administrator rights on the victim’s computer. In addition, the attackers trick their victims into running malware installers with an SCR extension – sometimes packed using RAR.  When the unsuspecting victims open an infected file, a backdoor is installed on their computer, giving the attackers full control.The cybercriminals behind Epic Turla also use watering-hole attacks that deploy a Java exploit (CVE-2012-1723), Adobe Flash exploits and Internet Explorer exploits. There are others that use social engineering to trick victims into running fake ‘Flash Player’ malware installers.  Depending on the IP address of the victim, the attackers serve Java or browser exploits, signed fake Adobe Flash Player software or a fake version of Microsoft Security Essentials. We have seen more than 100 injected web sites. Unsurprisingly, the choice of web sites reflects the specific interests of the attackers (as well as the interests of the victims). For example, many infected Spanish web sites belong to local governments.Once the computer is infected, the Epic Turla backdoor (known also as ‘WorldCupSec’, ‘TadjMakhal’, ‘Wipbot’ and ‘Tadvig’) immediately connects to the C2 server to send a pack containing the victim’s system information.   Based on the summary information sent to the C2 server, the attackers deliver pre-configured batch files containing a series of commands to be executed on the infected computer.   The attackers also upload custom lateral movement tools (including a specific keylogger and RAR archiver), as well as standard utilities such as a DNS query tool from Microsoft.Our analysis revealed that the Epic Turla backdoor is just the first stage of a wider infection process.  It is used to deploy a more sophisticated backdoor known as the ‘Cobra/Carbon system’ (named ‘Pfinet’ by some anti-malware products).  After some time, the attackers went further, using the Epic Turla implant to update the Carbon configuration file with a different set of C2 servers.  The unique knowledge to operate these two backdoors indicates a clear and direct connection between them:  one is used to gain a foothold and validate the high-profile victim.  If the victim proves to be of interest to the attackers, the compromised computer is upgraded to the full Carbon system.Here’s an overview of the whole Epic Turla cyber-espionage campaign:Attributing these attacks is always very difficult.  However, some aspects of the code tell us something about the attackers.  It’s clear that they are not native English speakers.  They commonly misspell words and phrases, such as:‘Password it’s wrong!’ ‘File is not exists’ ‘File is exists for edit’There are also other indicators that hint at the origin of the attackers.  For example, some of the backdoors have been compiled on a system with the Russian language.  In addition, the internal name of one of the Epic Turla backdoors is ‘Zagruzchik.dll’, which means ‘bootloader’ or ‘load program’ in Russian.  Finally, the Epic Turla ‘mother ship’ control panel sets the code page to 1251, which is used for Cyrillic characters.We have discussed this targeted attack campaign, which has now been active for 10 years, on several occasions.Earlier this year we observed an increase in the number of attacks on Uyghur and Tibetan activists, using an updated version of the NetTraveler backdoor.  The attackers use spear-phishing e-mails to lure their victims:  e-mails include a Microsoft Word document that contains the CVE-2012-0158 exploit.  This drops the main module (‘net.exe’) onto the computer, which in turn installs a number of other files, including the main C2 module.  This module is registered as a service (‘Windowsupdata’) by means of a Windows batch file called ‘dot.bat’.  The format of the malware configuration file has also been updated and it’s clear that the attackers have taken steps to try and conceal the configuration (but the encryption they used is weak).The focus of the attackers has changed over time.  For much of its existence, the main targets of NetTraveler were diplomatic, government and military organisations.  More recently, its cyber-espionage activities have focused more on organisations involved in space exploration, nano-technology, energy production, nuclear power, lasers, medicine and communications.A focus on Uyghur and Tibetan activists remains a core part of the attackers’ activities.Technology is now an integral part of our lives, so it’s hardly surprising to see a cyber-dimension to conflicts around the world.  This is especially true of the Middle East, where geo-political conflicts have intensified in recent years.  Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team  analysed the recent increase in malware activity in Syria.The people behind these attacks use social engineering tricks to lure their victims into opening infected files. They use e-mail, Skype messages, Facebook posts and YouTube videos.They use a variety of ‘hooks’ – preying on their victims’ trust in social networking forums, their curiosity about news related to the conflict in Syria, their fear of the government and their lack of technical awareness.Examples include a disturbing video on YouTube showing injured victims of recent bombings that also invites people to download a malicious program from a public file-sharing web site. We also found a set of compressed files on a popular social networking site which, when extracted, revealed a database containing a list of activists and wanted individuals in Syria. The download link for this database application was included in the information section of a video published on 9 November 2013. The attackers also make use of fake security solutions to trick their victims – including a fake anti-virus program called ‘Ammazon Internet Security’ and a Trojanised version of a legitimate network monitoring tool, Total Network Monitor. They don’t just spread fake security applications – we’ve also seen fake versions of the Whatsapp and Viber instant messaging apps.The attackers use a number of well-known remote administration tools (RATs), malicious programs that allow a remote ‘operator’ to control a compromised computer as if they had physical access to it.  These tools are widely used in cybercrime attacks of all kinds and even in some state-sponsored attacks.  The RATs used in this campaign include ‘ShadowTech’, ‘Xtreme’, ‘NjRAT’,’ Bitcoment’, ‘Dark Comet’ and ‘Blackshades’.  The malware is used to monitor the victims, to gather information and, in some cases, to try and shut down their operations.The victims of these attacks are not only located in Syria.  The attacks have also been seen in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Morocco, France and the United States.We were able to track the C2 servers of the attackers to IP addresses in Syria, Russia, Lebanon, the United States and Brazil.  In total, we found 110 files, 20 domains and 47 IP addresses associated with the attacks.The number of attacks has grown markedly over the last year.  In addition, it’s clear that the groups involved in the attacks are well organised.  So far the attackers have made use of established malware tools rather than developing their own (although they use a variety of obfuscation methods to bypass simple signature-based detection).  However, we think it’s likely that the number and sophistication of malware used in the region is likely to increase.You can find our full report on this malware here.Earlier this year Kaspersky Lab contributed to an alliance of law enforcement and industry organizations, co-ordinated by the United Kingdom National Crime Agency (NCA), to disrupt the infrastructure behind the Shylock Trojan.  This partnership shows how global cooperation on cybercrime can produce positive results.The Shylock banking Trojan, so-called because its code contains excerpts from Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice, was first discovered in 2011.  Like other well-known banking Trojans such as Zeus, SpyEye and Carberp, Shylock is a man-in-the-browser attack designed to steal banking login credentials from the computers of bank customers.  The Trojan uses a pre-configured list of target banks, located in different countries around the world.The Trojan injects fake data entry fields into web pages when they load on the victim’s browser.  Victims are typically tricked into running the malware by clicking on malicious links.  Shylock then seeks to access funds held in business or personal bank accounts, and transfers them to accounts under the control of the attackers.The focus of the cybercriminals changed over time.  When Shylock first appeared, it was aimed mainly at victims in the UK and, during the course of 2012, spread to other countries in Europe and to the United States.  By the end of 2013, the cybercriminals were more focused on developing markets such as Brazil, Russia and Vietnam.  You can find more information, including data on the spread of the malware, here.All banking Trojans, Shylock included, target bank customers, hoping to take advantage of what is often the least protected element of any financial transaction – i.e. the human.  That’s why it’s important that security starts at home – we all need to secure our computers effectively.The number of ransomware programs has been growing in recent years – not all of them focused on computers running Windows.  Some, including the ones targeting Android devices, tend to simply block access to the device and demand a ransom payment in order to unlock the device.But many ransomware programs go further than this, encrypting data on the victim’s computer.  One recent example is ZeroLocker.Unlike most ransomware programs, which encrypt a pre-defined list of file types, ZeroLocker encrypts nearly all the files on the victim’s computer and adds the extension ‘.encrypt’ to encrypted files.  ZeroLocker doesn’t encrypt files located in directories containing the words ‘Windows’, ‘WINDOWS’, ‘Program Files’, ‘ZeroLocker’ or ‘Destroy’ and doesn’t encrypt files larger than 20MB in size.ZeroLocker generates a 160-bit AES key to encrypt all files.  The key space is somewhat limited because of the way the key is generated, but it’s still large enough to make general brute –forcing unfeasible.  After encrypting files, the malware runs the ‘cipher.exe’ utility to remove all unused data from the drive, making file recovery much more difficult.  The encryption key, together with a CRC32 of the computer’s MAC address, and the associated Bitcoin wallet, is sent to the server used by the cybercriminals.  There’s an indication that the C2 configuration contains some errors that might prevent successful decryption – another reason why paying the ransom is a bad idea.The encryption key, along with other information, is sent by means of a GET request, rather than a POST.  This results in a 404 error on the server.  This could mean that the server isn’t storing the information, suggesting that the victims will probably not get their files back, even if they pay the ransom.Several other URLs that the malware tries to get also result in 404 errors.  This suggests that the operation may still be in its infancy.  If and when these errors are fixed, we may see ZeroLocker deployed on a larger scale.The cybercriminals behind ZeroLocker demand an initial $300 worth of Bitcoins to decrypt the file.  If the victim does not pay promptly the fee increases to $500 and $1,000 as time goes on.There’s a Bitcoin wallet hard-coded inside the binary, but the malware tries to fetch a new wallet address from the C2 server, probably to make it harder to trace how successful the operation is and where the money goes.  None of the Bitcoin wallet addresses we looked at had any transactions associated with them.  Since the C2 server provides Bitcoin wallet information, it’s possible that the attackers are able to use a unique wallet for each victim.Another ransomware program that we analysed recently is Onion.  This malicious program uses the tried-and-tested method used by other recent ransomware programs – encrypting the victim’s data and demanding a ransom payment in Bitcoin.However, it also breaks new ground.  First, Onion uses the anonymous Tor network to hide its C2 servers.  This makes it harder to track down the cybercriminals behind the malware.  Other malware has used Tor in the past, but this Trojan stands apart because it supports full interaction with Tor without any input from the victim.  Other programs like this communicate with the Tor network by launching (sometimes by injecting code into other processes) the legitimate ‘tor.exe’ file.  By contrast Onion implements this communication as part of the malware code itself.Onion also uses an unorthodox cryptographic algorithm that makes file decryption impossible, even if traffic between the Trojan and the C2 server is intercepted.  This Trojan not only uses asymmetric encryption, it also uses a cryptographic protocol known as ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman).  This makes decryption impossible without the master private key – which never leaves the cybercriminals’ controlled server.  Further details can be found in our report on the Onion Trojan.These things combined make the Onion Trojan technically advance and very dangerous.Ransomware operations rely on their victims paying up.  Don’t do it!  Instead, make regular backups of your data.  That way, if you ever fall victim to a ransomware program (or a hardware problem that stops you accessing your files) you will not lose any of your data.The Internet is becoming woven into the fabric of our lives – literally, in some cases, as connectivity is embedded into everyday objects.  This trend, known as the ‘Internet of Things’, has attracted more and more attention as hackers and researchers probe the technologies integrated into cars, hotels, home alarm systems and refrigerators and more – looking for vulnerabilities.Sometimes the Internet of things can seem remote. But it’s often closer than we think.  The modern home today is likely to have a handful of devices connected to the local network that aren’t traditional computers, tablets or cellphones – devices such as a smart TV, a printer, a gaming console, a network storage device or some kind of media player/satellite receiver.One of our security researchers, David Jacoby, investigated his own home, to determine whether it was really cyber-secure.  He looked at several devices, including network-attached storage (NAS) devices, smart TV, router and satellite receiver, to see if they were vulnerable to attack.  The results were striking.  David found 14 vulnerabilities in the network-attached storage devices, one in the smart TV and several potentially hidden remote control functions in the router.The most severe vulnerabilities were found in the network-attached storage devices.  Several of them would allow an attacker to remotely execute system commands with the highest administrative privileges.  The tested devices also had weak default passwords, stored passwords in plain text and included configuration files with the wrong permissions.  The default administrator password for one of the devices contained just one digit!  And another device even shared the entire configuration file, containing encrypted passwords, with everyone on the network!David was also able to upload a file to an area of storage memory that’s inaccessible to an ordinary user.  If an attacker uploaded a malicious file to this area, the compromised device would become a source of infection for other devices connecting to this NAS – a home PC, for example – and could even serve as a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) bot in a botnet. On top of this, the only way to delete this file was by using the same vulnerability –even for a technical specialist this is no simple task.When David looked at his smart TV, he discovered that communication between the TV and the TV vendor’s servers isn’t encrypted – potentially opening the way for a Man-in-the-Middle attack that could result in an unsuspecting consumer transferring money to fraudsters while trying to buy content via the TV.  As a proof of concept exercise, David was able to replace one of the icons on the smart TV graphic interface with a picture.  Normally the widgets and thumbnails are downloaded from the TV vendor’s servers but since the connection isn’t encrypted, this information could be modified by a third party.  He also discovered that the smart TV is able to execute Java code that, in combination with the ability to intercept the exchange of traffic between the TV and Internet, could result in exploit-driven malicious attacks.The DSL router, used to provide wireless Internet access for all other home devices, contained several dangerous features hidden from its owner.  Some of these hidden functions could potentially give an attacker remote access to any device in a private network.  What’s more, sections of the router’s web interface called ‘Web Cameras’, ‘Telephony Expert Configure’, ‘Access Control’, ‘WAN-Sensing’ and ‘Update’ are ‘invisible’ and cannot be adjusted by the owner of the device.  They can only be accessed by exploiting a rather generic vulnerability that makes it possible to travel between sections of the interface (these are basically web pages, each with its own alphanumeric address) by brute-forcing the numbers at the end of the address.  Originally these functions were implemented for the convenience of the owner of the device:  the remote access function makes it fast and easy for an ISP (Internet Service Provider) to troubleshoot and resolve technical problems on the device.  But this convenient feature could become a security risk if the controls fell into the wrong hands.In line with our policy of responsible disclosure, Kaspersky Lab hasn’t disclosed the names of vendors whose products were investigated as part of this research.  All vendors were informed about the existence of the vulnerabilities and Kaspersky Lab specialists work closely with vendors to help them remediate any vulnerabilities discovered.It’s important that we all understand the potential risks associated with using network devices – this applies to individuals and businesses alike.  We also need to understand that our information is not secure just because we use strong passwords or run software to protect against malicious code.  There are many things over which we have no control, and to some degree we are in the hands of software and hardware vendors.   For example, not all devices include automated update checks – sometimes consumers are required to download and install new firmware.  This is not always an easy task.  Worse still, it’s not always possible to update a device (most devices investigated during this research had been discontinued more than a year before).You can find some advice on how to reduce the risk of attack in this summary of David Jacoby’s article.In September, the information security world faced a red alert following the discovery of the ‘Bash’ vulnerability (also known as ‘ShellShock’). Bash, a Unix shell written in 1989, is the default shell on Linux and Mac OS X. The flaw (CVE-2014-6271) allows an attacker to remotely attach a malicious file to a variable that is executed when the Bash command interpreter is invoked. The high impact of this vulnerability, coupled with the ease with which it can be exploited, make it very powerful.  Some have compared it to the ‘Heartbleed’ vulnerability. However, Bash is much easier to exploit than Heartbleed and, whereas Heartbleed only allowed an attacker to steal data from the memory of a vulnerable computer, Shellshock could provide full system control.It didn’t take long for attackers to try and take advantage of the vulnerability – we discussed some early examples soon after it was discovered. In most cases attackers remotely attacked web servers hosting CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts that have been written in Bash or pass values to shell scripts. However, it is possible that the vulnerability could have an impact on a Windows-based infrastructure.Nor is the problem confined only to web servers. Bash is widely used in the firmware of devices that now take for granted in our everyday lives. This includes routers, home appliances and wireless access points. Some of these devices can be difficult, or impossible to patch – as discussed above.You can find guidance on how to update vulnerable systems here.All statistics used in this report were obtained using Kaspersky Security Network (KSN), a distributed antivirus network that works with various anti-malware protection components. The data was collected from KSN users who agreed to transfer it. Millions of Kaspersky Lab products users from 213 countries and territories worldwide participate in this global exchange of information about malicious activity.In Q3 2014 Kaspersky Lab mobile security products detected 74,489 new malicious mobile programs, 14.4% more than in the second quarter.At the same time, fewer installation packages were detected.Number of installation packages and new malicious mobile programs detected in Q1-Q3 2014In the first half of 2014, there were a little more than 11 malicious installation packages on the average associated with each malicious program but in Q3 there were 6.2 million.Using multiple installation packages for one mobile malicious program is typical of SMS-Trojan distributors. For example, attackers have used up to 70,000 packets for one version of Stealer.a. The decrease in the number of malicious installation packages is probably related to the reduced proportion of this malware in the flow of new mobile malicious programs decreased (see below).Distribution of mobile threats by type in Q2 and Q3 2014The rating of malware objects for mobile devices for the third quarter of 2014 was headed by RiskTool. This claimed 26.5% of detections, a rise of 8.6 percentage points. These are legal applications that are potentially dangerous for the user – if they are used carelessly, or manipulated by a cybercriminal they could lead to financial losses.Second came Adware, potentially unwanted advertising applications (19.4%); their contribution went down 7.9 pp.SMS-Trojans were in 3rd place: their share declined by 7.2pp from the previous quarter.In Q3, while Adware and SMS-Trojans were less widely seen, we observed a sharp rise in the percentage of banking Trojans: their share in the flow of mobile malware has risen from 2.2% to 9.2% which placed this category 4th in the rating.*The percentage of all attacks recorded on the mobile devices of unique users.The top 20 is no longer so heavily dominated by SMS Trojans: in Q2 2014 these malicious programs occupied 15 places in the rating while in Q3 there were only 8. Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.Stealer.a  topped the previous quarter’s rating with 25.42% of all attacks but in Q3 it accounted for only 16.63% of attacks.RiskTool representatives occupied 6 positions in the Top 20, with RiskTool.AndroidOS.SMSreg.gc (14.17%) in second place.7th came  DangerousObject.Multi.Generic (3.94%), demonstrating how new malicious applications are detected by Kaspersky Security Network cloud technologies that enable our product to quickly respond to new unknown threats.In the third quarter, we detected 7010 mobile banking Trojans, 3.4 times more than last quarter.Number of mobile banking Trojans detected, Q1-Q3 2014The number of countries attacked by banking Trojans also increased: in Q2 mobile banking Trojan attacks were detected in 31 countries while in Q3 there were 70.The geography of mobile banking threats, Q3 2014 (the number of attacked users)The top 10 countries attacked by banking Trojans* The percentage of users attacked per countryItaly dropped out of the Top 10 while Saudi Arabia appeared in 10th place.Russia maintained its traditional lead here, although it was 7.85pp on before. At the same time the contribution of the other Top 10 members grew slightly: mobile cybercriminals are gradually extending their area of activity.In Q3 2014 mobile malicious attacks were detected at least once in 205 countries.The geography of infection by mobile banking Trojans, Q3 2014 (the percentage of all attacked users)The Top 10 of attacked countries* The percentage of users attacked per countryRussia remained the most heavily targeted nation with 44% of all attacks. India (7.6%) returned to second place. For the first time in 2014 Iran (3.4%) and the USA (1.7%) entered the Top 10 while Poland, France, Spain and Mexico were the Q3 outsiders.The rating of vulnerable applications below is based on information about the exploits blocked by our products. These exploits were used by hackers in Internet attacks and when compromising local applications, including those installed on mobile devices.The distribution of web-exploits used by fraudsters, by type of application attacked, Q3 2014Of all registered attempts to use vulnerabilities, 47% involved vulnerabilities in browsers. Almost every exploit pack includes an exploit for Internet Explorer.Java exploits are in second place. Java vulnerabilities are used in drive-by attacks via the Internet and new Java exploits are part of many exploit packs although no new Java vulnerabilities have been made public for almost a year. In Q3 of this year, 28% of attempts to use vulnerabilities targeted Java; in the first quarter the figure was 29%.Next come Adobe Reader exploits (12%). These vulnerabilities are also exploited in drive-by attacks via the Internet and PDF exploits feature in many exploit packs.The statistics in this section were derived from web antivirus components that protect users when malicious code attempts to download from a malicious/infected website. Malicious websites are deliberately created by malicious users; infected sites include those with user-contributed content (such as forums) as well as legitimate resources that have been hacked.During the reporting period, Kaspersky Lab solutions blocked 696,977 attacks that attempted to launch malware capable of stealing money from online banking accounts. This figure represents a 24.9% decrease compared to Q2 (927,568).The number of computers attacked by financial malware, Q3 2014The number of attacks gradually declined throughout the quarter: in June 244,490 attacks were blocked while in September this figure was 218,384 (-11%).A total of 2,466,952 notifications of malicious activity by programs designed to steal money via online access to bank accounts were registered by Kaspersky Lab security solutions in Q3 2014.The geography of banking malware attacks in Q2 2014 (by number of attacked users in the country)The Top 10 countries by the number of attacked users:Brazil remained the country where users are most often attacked by banking malware, even if its share was down one third. Russia stayed in second place. Italy dropped to 4th position while Germany rose to 3rd place: the number of attacked users in this country grew by 1.5 times.The table below shows the programs most commonly used to attack online banking users in Q3 2014, based on the number of reported infection attempts:Zeus (Trojan-Spy.Win32.Zbot) remained the most widespread banking Trojan although the number of attacks involving this malicious the program, as well as the number of attacked users, nearly halved compared with the previous quarter.In Q3, 3rd place was oc [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1055 Process Injection,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"

Also of note this week was Facebook’s crackdown of more than 800 accounts that the company said were spreading misinformation, as well as new fake Adobe Flash samples discovered peddling cryptominers and a new Android trojan strain found in the wild that researchers said could change the malware game forever. : Podcasts Privacy Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer </s>"
"Rapid7 warned this week that its Nexpose appliances were shipped with a SSH configuration that could have let obsolete algorithms be used for key exchange. Rapid7 encouraged owners of its Nexpose appliances this week to apply an update to their systems to tweak how SSH is configured by default. The company warned on Wednesday the devices were shipped with an SSH configuration that could have let some obsolete KEX, encryption and MAC algorithms be used for key exchange. Nexpose devices are preconfigured servers, deployed in server racks, designed to help users gauge vulnerabilities, manage vulnerability data, and limit threat exposure. All physical Nexpose appliances are affected per a disclosure by Samuel Huckins, a program manager with the company, published on Wednesday. Liam Somerville, a researcher based in Scotland, discovered the vulnerability (CVE-2017-5243) and reported it to the company three weeks ago. Nothing needs to be downloaded to resolve the issue, but a file does need to edited, Rapid7 said. According to Huckins, to fix the vulnerability a user with root access has to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config in the appliance to ensure only modern ciphers, key exchange, and MAC algorithms are accepted. This should lessen the likelihood of any attacks involving authentication. Prior to the fix, weak and out of date encryption algorithms such as AES192-CBC, Blowfish-CBC, and 3DES-CBC, and KEX algorithms such as diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1, could have been enabled. “This change should not impact connections from Nexpose instances to the physical appliance. The main impact is shoring up access by SSH clients such that they cannot connect to the appliance using obsolete algorithms,” Huckins wrote. According to Tod Beardsley, Research Director at Rapid7, the vulnerability could have let an attacker in a privileges position on the network force an algorithm downgrade between an SSH client and Nexpose during authentication. “The privileged position is crucial to making the attack a success, since it’s a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack — first, the attacker needs to be able to insert himself between the client and server, which usually means the attacker is on the same network as either endpoint, or has compromised an ISP along the way (in which case you have bigger problems),” Beardsley told Threatpost late Friday, “Once there, the attacker can pose as both sides of the initial SSH handshake, and rewrite the handshake to request one of these older, obsolete algorithms. Once that’s done, the attacker then records the session, and then can decrypt the session offline.” Beardsley says that removing server-side support for the algorithms makes the aforementioned kind of attack impractical and that overall, the actual risk of exploitation is fairly low. “These appliances don’t tend to be exposed on public networks, so attackers need to be ‘on the inside’ to begin with,” Beardsley said, “… The whole point of SSH is to be resistant to this kind of session meddling, even in the face of an attacker who’s in the right place and has the right expertise and resources to mount this sort attack. By strengthening what’s available on the server, we can help keep that promise of confidentiality.” *This article was updated at 4:30 p.m. EST to include comments from Tod Beardsley of Rapid7. : Vulnerabilities","T1021 Remote Services,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Rapid7 warned this week that its Nexpose appliances were shipped with a SSH configuration that could have let obsolete algorithms be used for key exchange.

"Exploit acquisition vendor Zerodium said Wednesday it will pay up to $1M for an unknown Tor Browser zero day. The exploit acquisition vendor Zerodium is doubling down again. Weeks after the company said it would pay $500,000 for zero days in private messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp, Zerodium said Wednesday it will pay twice that for a zero day in Tor Browser. The company said it will pay up to $1 million for fully functional, unknown zero day exploits for Tor Browser on Tails Linux and Windows. Specifically, the company said it will pay $250,000 for combined remote code execution and local privilege escalation bugs that work on both Tails and Windows to root/system, or $200,000 for combined bugs in Tails or Windows. It will pay an abbreviated bounty for just RCE vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities executed when JavaScript is allowed. The company said that any exploits that require manipulating of Tor nodes, or exploits that would disrupt the network itself won’t be accepted. Submissions must include the full, unknown and previously unpublished, exploit, alongside a whitepaper explaining the techniques. Zerodium says an attack vector has to be a web page targeting the latest version of the browser, either in its default configuration where JavaScript is allowed to run with its security settings set to low, or in a hardened configuration where JavaScript is blocked. Like it did when it announced the messaging app bounties, Zerodium says the Tor bounty is designed to help its government customers track criminals who use the anonymous browser. When reached on Wednesday, a Tor Project spokesperson said the high payout was a good example of the security the browser provides. But, he also suggested participating in Zerodium’s bug bounty program could put Tor users’ lives at stake. “We think the amount of the bounty is a testament to the security we provide. We think it’s in the best interest of all Tor users, including government agencies, for any vulnerabilities to be disclosed to us through our own bug bounty. Over 1.5 million people rely on Tor everyday to protect their privacy online, and for some it’s life or death. Participating in Zerodium’s program would put our most at-risk users’ lives at stake.” Zerodium, launched in 2015 by VUPEN cofounder Chaouki Bekrar, has made a name for itself by offering lofty payouts for high-risk zero-day exploits. Shortly after it was founded the company offered a million-dollar bounty centered on iOS 9. It then one upped itself by offering a $1.5 million bounty for information pertaining to an iOS 10 remote jailbreak around this time last year. The company in August said that a spike in demands from its customers, democratic and non-sanctioned governments, combined with the small attack surface of private messaging apps, led to a change in bounty pricing. Zerodium said Wednesday the fact the Tor Browser is used in “many cases” by attackers to carry out drug trafficking and child abuse has helped contributed to demand for zero days. When reached Wednesday, Bekrar said that previous Tor zero days, notably those used in 2013 and 2016, didn’t threaten the lives of any users. “All known Tor Browsers exploits that have been used by Gov agencies in the past (2013 & 2016) didn’t threaten life of ANY legitimate user,”,” Bekrar said, Those exploits were all used against pedophiles & drug traffickers, and Tor Project should stop defending these people.” Unlike the private messaging app bounty, which is ongoing, the company’s Tor Browser exploit bounty is limited. Zerodium said the Tor bounty is open until November 30 at 6 p.m., or until the payout reaches $1 million, but hat the company will still entertain exploits after the fact. “As we’ve set the prices very high, we had to limit this in time,” Bekrar said, “After the deadline, we will still acquire such exploits as part of our usual program and prices.” *This article was updated at 10 a.m. Sept 14 with comments from Chaouki Bekrar : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1021 Remote Services,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] Exploit acquisition vendor Zerodium said Wednesday it will pay up to $1M for an unknown Tor Browser zero day.

"The attack targets IKE’s handshake implementation used for IPsec-based VPN connections, opening the door for MiTM attacks or for bad actors to access data carried in VPN sessions. A new Bleichenbacher oracle cryptographic attack has been set loose on the world, using a 20-year-old protocol flaw to compromise the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol used to secure IP communications. Specifically, the attack targets IKE’s handshake implementation used for IPsec-based VPN connections. Attackers might be able to use the vulnerability to retrieve IKEv1 session keys and decrypt connections, ultimately opening the door to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks or for bad actors to access data carried in VPN sessions. The consequences could be far-ranging; as is commonly known, VPNs allow employees to securely access a corporate network while they are outside the office. However, they also allow companies to connect their local networks over the public internet, as is the case with the Automotive Network Exchange (ANX), which connects automakers with their suppliers; and in wireless 4G networks, wireless carriers use VPNs to secure the backhaul links between their cell towers and the core network. Dissidents and journalists also use VPNs to circumvent geo-restrictions, hostile surveillance and censorship. The technique, uncovered by a team of academic researchers from the Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany and the University of Opole, Poland, involves reusing a key pair across different versions and modes of IKE, which can lead to cross-protocol authentication bypass. That allows an attacker to spoof the targeted IPSec endpoint, and to eventually break the encryption mechanism. “We exploit a Bleichenbacher oracle in an IKEv1 mode, where RSA encrypted nonces are used for authentication,” explained the team, in a paper set to be presented at the Usenix Security Symposium this week. “[The attack covers] all available authentication mechanisms of IKE.” How It Works IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) is a protocol stack that protects network packets at the IP layer. But to establish a shared secret for an IPsec connection, the IKE protocol has to be executed. IKE consists of two phases, where Phase 1 is used to establish initial authenticated keying material between two peers. Phase 2 is used to negotiate further derived keys for many different IP-based connections between the two. The proof-of-concept targets only Phase 1 in IKEv1 and IKEv2, where the attacker impersonates an IKE device. “Once attackers succeed with this attack on Phase 1, they share a set of (falsely) authenticated symmetric keys with the victim device, and can successfully complete Phase 2 – this holds for both IKEv1 and IKEv2,” the paper detailed. In IKEv1, four authentication methods are available for Phase 1: Two RSA encryption-based methods, one signature-based method, and a pre-shared key (PSK)-based method. In IKEv2, Phase 1 omits the encryption-based authentication methods, leaving only signature- and PSK-based authentication methods. The attacks are based on Bleichenbacher oracles – a 20-year-old protocol threat that has been used through the years to break the confidentiality of TLS when used with RSA encryption. The researchers have now found that these same oracles “can very efficiently be used to decrypt nonces,” which breaks the RSA-encrypted authentication in IKE’s Phase 1. Also, the paper shows that they can be used to forge digital signatures, which breaks the signature-based authentication in Phase 1; and on the PSK front, offline dictionary attacks are possible, according the researchers, rounding out the protection compromises. Patches Roll Out Cisco and Huawei issued patches for the issue yesterday. For Cisco, the flaw exists in its flagship Internetworking Operating System (IOS), which powers most of its routers and switches, and in its Linux-based offshoot, IOS XE – if the “authentication rsa-encr” option is enabled. Another operating system branch, IOS XR, is used for carrier-grade infrastructure and is not affected. “The vulnerability exists because the affected software responds incorrectly to decryption failures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability sending crafted ciphertexts to a device configured with IKEv1 that uses RSA-encrypted nonces,” Cisco explained in its security advisory. For Huawei’s part, the issue targets IPSec IKEv1 implementations of Huawei Firewall products. “Remote attackers can decrypt IPSec tunnel ciphertext data by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle,” the Chinese giant noted in its own advisory. “Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can impact IPSec tunnel security.” The attack is known to affect IKEv1 implementations by Cisco (CVE-2018-0131), Huawei (CVE-2017-17305), Clavister (CVE-2018-8753, already patched, affecting the Clavister cOS Core) and ZyXEL (CVE-2018-9129, also already patched, affecting all ZyWALL/USG devices). The academic team previously privately disclosed the problem to the four vendors; however, the paper noted that all versions and variants of the IPsec’s IKE protocol can be broken, if weak PSKs and Bleichenbacher oracles in the IKEv1 PKE and RPKE variants are present – thus, more implementations in major operating systems and network devices could be affected, depending on configuration.   : Cryptography Editor's Picks Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1021 Remote Services,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] The attack targets IKE’s handshake implementation used for IPsec-based VPN connections, opening the door for MiTM attacks or for bad actors to access data carried in VPN sessions.

"Our annual report on malware evolution in 2007, published a few months ago, contained forecasts on how the threat landscape would evolve in 2008. Now that the first three months of the year have passed, we can start to draw some preliminary conclusions.Unfortunately, as often happens in the antivirus industry, the conclusions are fairly discouraging. The speed at which the number of malicious programs is rising continues to increase, with thousands of new variants being detected every day. This is starting to be accompanied by increased technical sophistication, and we are also seeing a shift in attack vectors, with malicious users starting to direct their attention to less well protected fields, such as Web 2.0 technologies and mobile devices.We continue to see the reincarnation of old ideas and techniques, and the implementation of these at new levels enhances the level of threat. Examples are infecting boot sectors on victim machines; spreading malicious programs via storage media, and infecting files.It looks as though the first quarter of 2008 brought the symbolic, but irrevocable death of the old school of virus writing. At the end of February, the site of the legendary 29A group officially announced that the group would cease to exist.The people who had created “Cap” (the first macro virus to cause a global epidemic), “Stream” (the first virus for additional NTFS streams), “Donut” (the first virus for the .NET platform), “Rugrat” (the first virus for the Win64 platform), the mobile viruses Cabir and Duts and many others, have now retreated, under pressure from the increased criminalization of the world of virus writers. No one creates malicious programs to express themselves, assert their personality or for research purposes anymore – it’s far more profitable to generate hundreds of primitive Trojan programs and then sell them.The death of 29A was commented on by nearly all the major antivirus companies: each company threw a virtual clod of earth on the grave of the group which in its time created many difficulties for virus analysts. So it’s fitting that we should also mention the event.As for what came to replace the ‘romantic’ ideal of virus writing in 2008, this is discussed in the following chapters:Bootkit rootkits – rootkits with the ability to boot from the boot sector of any device – became, de facto, the main problem for the antivirus industry at the start of 2008. Although the efforts made to combat this problem, and the seriousness of the issue may not have been obvious to the public at large, it may be that the subject will come to cause problems for everyone in the near future.It all started in November 2007, or perhaps, more correctly, in 2005. However, this isn’t totally correct either. Let’s take a quick trip into the past and recall what took place 22 years ago, in 1986.This is how the events of that year are described in the Virus Encyclopaedia on viruslist.com (http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?chapter=153311030):The first global IBM-compatible virus epidemic was detected. Brain, which infected the boot sector, was able to spread practically worldwide within a few months. The almost total lack of awareness in the computing community of how to protect machines against viruses ensured Brain’s success. In fact, the appearance of numerous science fiction works on the topic only strengthened the panic, instead of teaching people about security.The Brain virus was written by a 19 year old Pakistani programmer, Basit Farooq Alvi, and his brother Amjad, and included a text string containing their names, address and telephone number. According to the virus’s authors, who worked in sales for a software company, they wanted to gauge the level of piracy in their country. Aside from infecting a disc’s boot sector and changing the disk name to ‘© Brain’, the virus did nothing; it had real payload, and did not corrupt data. Unfortunately, the brothers lost control of their so-called experiment and Brain spread worldwide.Interestingly enough, Brain was also the first ‘stealth virus.’ When an attempt to read the infected sector was detected, the virus would display the original, uninfected data.So this was the start of the story. For more than 10 years, boot viruses were one of the most widespread type of malicious programs.The principle on which these viruses work is relatively simple: they use algorithms which launch the operating system when the computer is switched on or rebooted. The system boot program reads the first physical sector of the boot disk (A:, C:, or the CD-ROM drive, depending on BIOS Setup parameters) and pass control to it. If there is a virus on the boot sector, the virus will gain control.There’s only one method known which is used to infect floppies: the virus replaces the original boot sector code on the disk with its own code. The hard drive can be infected in three different ways – the virus either replaces the MBR code with its own code; replaces the boot sector code on the boot disk (usually C:) with its own code, or modifies the address of the active boot sector in the Disk Partition Table located on the hard drive MBR.In the majority of cases, when infecting the disk the virus moves the original boot sector (or the MBR) to another disk sector (for instance, to the first free sector).Developers started adding protection to prevent the MBR from being written to. Windows 95/98 appeared, floppies started to disappear from use, and after almost a decade, boot sector viruses faded from the landscape, becoming part of the history of virology.However, at Black Hat USA in 2005, Derek Soeder and Ryan Permeh, two researchers from eEye Digital Security, presented BootRoot. This technology made it possible to place code on the boot sector of the disk – code that would intercept the booting of the Windows kernel and launch a backdoor, making it possible to remotely administer the machine via the local network.This work attracted a certain amount of attention, and it was soon emulated. In January 2006, John Hesman from Next-Generation Security Software announced that functions for managing the electricity supply of the computer (the so-called ACPI – Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) make it possible to create programs which implement rootkit functions that can be saved to the BIOS flash memory. Malicious code saved in this location (BIOS) is more difficult to detect than in the case of the boot backdoor. Hesman also created prototype code which makes it possible to increase system privileges and read data from the computer memory.A year later, at the end of 2007, two Indian programmers called Nitin and Vipin Kumar presented Vbootkit – a rootkit with a function making it capable of launching from the boot sector of any device. The program can also run on Windows Vista. The source code was not made public, but was passed to some antivirus companies.The main principle behind Vbootkit is shown below:The authors promised to implement BIOS infection in the next version of the bootkit.In other words, what came to pass was no surprise – old technology for infecting the boot sector was combined with the fashion for rootkits. In spite of the fact that nearly all antivirus companies today are able to scan the boot sector of disks, it’s still difficult to detect if system functions have been intercepted or substituted. And this is true even in the case of a Trojan and an antivirus running on one operating system, without even addressing a backdoor which starts before the operating system has launched.All of the above seems like a potentially explosive mixture that could go up at any moment. And the explosion came in November 2007, although news of this came slightly later, at the end of December, when several thousand users (there is no exact data on the number of infections) came under attack from the first malicious implementation of a bootkit.Between the 19th and the 28th December several websites appeared which used drive-by downloads (infecting a victim machine by placing exploits on a web site which then download a malicious program). A detailed analysis of the malicious program revealed code able to infect the MBR and hard disk sectors.Once on the victim machine, the malicious code modifies the MBR, writes the rootkit part to a disk sector, extracts a Windows backdoor from itself, installs the backdoor, and then deletes itself.When infecting the MBR, instructions pass control to the main part of the rootkit which is placed on several hard disk sectors and which is not represented as files in the system. This part monitors the already loaded Windows operating system and when reading, it hides the infected MBR and the “dirty” sectors by presenting clean ones instead. It does this by intercepting and substituting system functions.In addition to hiding its presence in the system, the malicious code installs a backdoor in Windows; the backdoor will steal user data, including user data to a range of online banking systems.A reconstruction of events based on the variants of the rootkits detected, analysis of the infected sites and the code of the malicious program downloaded from these sites showed that from November 2007, the unknown authors had been preparing to launch their code on the world. Several of the first variants of this malicious program stem from mid-November to mid-December; these are effectively alpha versions which contain serious errors in the code, and indicate that the authors were searching for optimal variants.The code released at the end of December was already relatively effective. We classified the malicious program, which combined the functions of a bootkit and a backdoor, as Backdoor.Win32.Sinowal. This was because many of the functions in the backdoor, and also the method used to ‘litter’ code were identical to those which we are familiar with in Trojan-PSW.Win32.Sinowal.In spite of increased sophistication and the many innovations implemented in the bootkit, it’s only able to protect itself – this leaves the backdoor file open to being detected and deleted. This indicates that different people were involved in developing the bootkit and the backdoor, and there are a number of reasons to suggest that the bootkit was created by virus writers from Russia. There are well known cases in which virus writers have worked together. However, the result in this case suggests a warrior who has been hastily dressed in another’s reforged armour which is, effectively, useless.Nevertheless, the bootkit appears to be a self-sufficient platform – something that could be added to any existing malicious program in order to protect that program and mask its presence in the system. It may be that bootkits for sale will appear in the near future, making the technology available to thousands of script kiddies. Taking into account the rate at which the number of malicious programs is increasing, this could become one of the most widespread threats.Why is it so difficult to protect against bootkits? The main problems are as follows:Of course, the best protection is to prevent the system from getting infected in the first place – after all, a bootkit doesn’t materialize out of thin air. It has to get onto the computer somehow. Some antivirus programs are able to prevent infection even by unknown variants of malicious programs. However, there is always the possibility that such protection can be penetrated, and this raises the question of how to disinfect an already infected machine.Here there are two options – either an antivirus is already installed on the system (in such cases, the four points mentioned above relate to the antivirus solution) or there is no antivirus, and one needs to be installed. In the second case, we encounter an additional problem related to that in point 1; the malicious code can block attempts to install an antivirus solution on the infected system.Virus writers have analysed how antivirus companies solve the problems listed above, and in February 2008, a new improved version of the bootkit was released. All the methods previously implemented to combat bootkits turned out to be useless.At the same time, the bootkit started spreading in new ways. Links to sites containing exploits which would install the bootkit were discovered on a number of European sites which had been hacked.So far, apart from Sinowal, we haven’t detected any other malicious programs which come equipped with a bootkit. At the moment, the standoff between antivirus companies and virus writers is following the classic path of attack and counter-attack. Even the latest variants of the bootkit can be combated without significant innovations in antivirus solutions.However, looking a couple of steps down the line it’s clear that sooner or later that only one method will guarantee that such malicious programs can be detected and deleted. This will entail a shift from software protection to hardware protection.The key question is what gains control first – if it’s the virus, then an antivirus will, a priori, be useless.So, viruses have (again) reached the MBR. 10 years ago we solved this problem by using a boot disk equipped with an antivirus. It may be that the time is coming when we’ll see the return of not just old virus technologies, but old antivirus technologies as well.Mid January 2008 marked the first anniversary of the appearance of the first samples of what would become known, variously, as Zhelatin, Nuwar or the Storm Worm. Until then, computer virology had not encountered such a vigorously and variedly evolving malicious program.Zhelatin continued to use and develope the concepts which had been implemented in the Bagle and Warezov worms. Zhelatin took its modular structure from Bagle, and copied Warezov in the frequent release of new variants. It also resembled Warezov in moving away from mass-mailing the main component via email, instead using hundreds of infected sites as well as Skype and IM to spread the malicious code. Added to all of this were social engineering tricks, rootkit technologies, methods for launching counter attacks on antivirus companies, and a decentralized botnet. In less than a year, the Storm Worm became the information security industry’s main problem, due to its almost mythical botnet.The exact dimensions of the Storm botnet remain a mystery. In 2007 we heard a widely varying range of estimates of the number of infected machines, and these estimates were all voiced around the same time. For instance, in September some experts estimated that the botnet had 2 million machines; others put the figure at between 250,000 and a million, while a third group believed the size to be 150,000 machines. There were even those who talked of 50 million infected computers! The reason for such a wide variety of figures is clear – because of the decentralized nature of the botnet, it’s impossible to establish the exact number of zombie machines. Estimates can only be made based on indirect indicators, which are of course debateable.Whichever way you look at it, the Storm botnet did exist. However, it was inactive. There was no ‘classic’ botnet activity detected; it wasn’t used for mass mailings, or to conduct DDoS attacks (which, incidentally, doesn’t rule out the botnet having been created by cybercriminal for criminal use). This left the impression that the botnet didn’t perform any function apart from spreading the Storm worm itself (it did this by sending new messages containing links to infected sites and then placing modules on the infected machines which would then be downloaded onto new victim machines). It really wasn’t clear why the botnet had been created: simply for the sake of it? But that doesn’t happen – botnets take far too many resources to create and maintain.Around October 2007, the frequency of mass mailings conducted by Zhelatin started to decline somewhat. Experts who had previously talked about millions of infected machines started to drop their estimates of the size of the botnet to between 150,000 and 200,000 computers. The suspicious emerged that the botnet was being prepared to be sold on in sections. Around the same time, the first mass mailings of spam from computers infected with the Storm Worm were detected. However, it couldn’t be stated conclusively that spam was being sent via the botnet, rather than via other malicious programs which might also be located on the victim machines.The end of 2007 and the early months of 2008 provided an answer to the question of what was happening with the Storm Worm.At Christmas, the worm reappeared. The botnet started sending out millions of messages with titles such as “Find Some Christmas Tail”, “Warm up this Christmas” and “Mrs. Clause Is Out Tonight!”. The messages were designed to entice the user to a site called merrychristmasdude.com, which contained exploits that would conduct a drive-by download to get the Storm Worm onto victim machines. In actual fact, merrychristmasdude.com wasn’t a single site which could have been closed down in order to prevent infection. Zhelatin used fast-flux, a technique for changing DNS addresses which constantly modifies the location of the site between more than a thousand deliberately prepared computers.Similar attacks, with only slight variations, carried on over the next few days, up until 15th January, when something strange happened. Either it was a joke on the part of the authors, or they simply made a mistake; whatever the case, the botnet started sending out messages containing Valentine’s cards, even though Valentine’s Day was still a month off.The messages had titles such as “Sent with Love”, “Our Love is Strong”, “Your Love Has Opened” and so on. Naturally, the messages led the user to the fast-flux site currently being used.The mass mailings in January turned out to be on a larger scale and also more intrusive than those which were conducted in the second half of 2007. They were also the largest mass mailings carried out in the first quarter of 2008. The authors of Zhelatin had struck a series of blows to either return the botnet to its original size or perhaps even to enlarge it. Computers infected by Zhelatin started to participate in DoS attacks, and MessageLabs started estimating that the Storm botnet was behind almost 20% of spam currently being sent out.At approximately the same time Fortinet announced it believed the botnet was part of phishing attacks launched against the Barclays and Halifax banks. If this is the case, then it is the first time the Storm botnet has been directly used for classic cybercrime aims.At the same time as the Storm Worm increased its activity, talk turned to the need to catch and sentence its authors. However, experts couldn’t agree on even the nationality of those behind the worm, never mind naming names.At the moment, there are two prevailing points of view. Dmitry Alperovitch from Secure Computing believes that a Russian is responsible, even going so far as to point to a location in St. Petersburg. He draws parallels with the notorious Russian Business Network (RBN) and the authors of the exploit bundle Mpack. Many experts support the view of the worm’s Russian origins.Others believe that the Storm Worm has been created by Americans. This argument is supported by the fact that the authors, in their use of social engineering tactics, demonstrate a suspiciously good knowledge of American life and psychology. The mass mailings play on specific incidents and events which will be of particular interest to the American public. And these events could well be unknown to virus writers from other countries, and particularly those from Russia.We do not have any information which supports one point of view or the other. It seems to us that one of the most likely scenarios is that an international group which has clearly defined responsibilities lies behind this activity. Someone creates the worm; someone else is responsible for mass mailings; someone else places the worm on the infected sites; someone else hacks the sites; someone else is responsible for spreading the malicious program via instant messaging, and finally, yet another person is responsible for creating the exploits.The widespread nature of the Storm Worm and the attack vectors which are being used are far too extensive to be within the capabilities of one, two or three people. If our suppositions are correct, then the Storm Worm is a text book example of modern cybercrime and its international distribution of labour. It is of course true that it is still unclear how the cybercriminals are making money using the Storm Worm.While we were still looking for the answers to the questions raised by the Storm Worm, at the end of March its authors sent out the latest flood of messages. The occasion – April 1st, known throughout the US, Europe and Russia as April Fool’s Day.The question remains: who will have the last laugh?Although incidents in which legitimate programs and software companies spread infection are relatively rare, they do exist in the information security world. Past cases have ranged from infected distributions to infected document files being sent to clients and partners.Every incident of this nature has a significant effect on the reputation either of the software or of the company concerned. They affect users who do observe the basic rules of computer security and cause problems for antivirus companies who view legitimate software and the sources it stems from as trustworthy.The first quarter of 2008 brought the latest case of this type.At the beginning of March, Kaspersky Lab analysts received messages from users saying that a Trojan was present in the directory of the popular download client FlashGet. Analysis showed that the problem affected users throughout the world. The symptoms of infection were the appearance of files called inapp4.exe, inapp5.exe and inapp6.exe in the system. Kaspersky Anti-Virus detected these files as Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.exo, Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.ezo and Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.kht.It was a strange situation: no other Trojan program which could have got this Trojan onto the system was detected. Some of the victims had fully patched operating systems and browsers. So how could these malicious programs have penetrated the infected machines?What attracted our attention straight away was the location of the Trojans – in the FlashGet directory itself. A quick check showed that apart from the presence of the Trojan files, the FGUpdate3.ini file had recently been created and modified (the blue text shows the differences from the original file):The link to inapp4.exe (the Trojan file) led to the genuine FlashGet site: the Trojan would download from the site in the form of a file called appA.cab.There wasn’t any information about the incident on the FlashGet site, and a look at the user’s forum returned a lot of messages about both about infections, and the fact that the developers were remaining silent on this matter.Information found on the Internet showed that the first cases of infection had been detected back on 29th February. The most recent infection that we knew of at that time had been on 9th March. For ten days, a legitimate program had been acting as a Trojan downloader program, installing and launching Trojan programs placed on the developers’ site on victim machines.It might have seemed that the incident was over – when we published information about this case, the Trojans had already been deleted from the site, and the FGUpdate3.ini file (which is also downloaded from the Internet) had been reverted to its original condition. However, in less than two weeks, on 22nd March, Steve Bass, the editor of the popular publication PC World, detected Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.kht in his FlashGet directory. It looked as though history was repeating itself – both the FlashGet site and the program itself were once again spreading malicious code.We can see two ways in which FlashGet could be transformed into a Trojan downloader program.The first is the most obvious explanation – the site itself was hacked. As a result, a malicious user would be able to replace the standard configuration file with a file that would lead to the Trojan placed on the site. We don’t know why the hackers didn’t use a different site – it might be that they worked on the principle that hiding in plain view (e.g. a link to the FlashGet file in the configuration file would not raise suspicions) would be the best disguise.We decided to check if it would be possible to use this trick to download any other files from any other sites. The answer: yes. All you need to do is add a link to the FGUpdate3.ini file. And that link can lead to anything, which will then be automatically downloaded and launched on your computer each time FlashGet is launched. Even if you don’t press “Refresh”, FlashGet will independently use the information from the .ini file.The ‘vulnerability’ is present in all versions of FlashGet 1.9.xx. This means that even though the hack of the FlashGet site has been fixed, the vulnerability in the user’s system remains. Any Trojan program can modify the local FlashGet .ini file, making it act as a Trojan downloader. And it’s this method which is the second of the two mentioned above.Is there any need to stress the fact that FlashGet is usually treated as a trusted application, and that any network activity generated by the program is seen as legitimate, as well as contacting any sites?There has, to date, been no official reaction from the Chinese company which develops FlashGet. The true cause of the incident remains unknown, and there is no guarantee that it will not happen again. You can draw your own conclusions…Antivirus companies retain the right to decide whether or not FlashGet is potentially malicious, and have started to classify it as Riskware. There are more than enough grounds for doing so.We wrote about the danger caused by social networking sites in our annual report. We forecast that in 2008 users of social networking sites will become the main targets for phishing attacks. There will start to be increased demand among malicious users for account data to services such as Facebook, MySpace, LiveJournal, Blogger and others. This will become a dangerous alternative to placing malicious programs on hacked sites. In 2008, many Trojan programs will spread via user accounts on social networking sites, on their blogs and on their profiles.February 2008 met these expectations in full. Once again Orkut, the popular social networking site owned by Google, came under attack.Orkut is extremely popular in a number of countries through the world, and particularly in Brazil and India. According to data provided by Alexa.com, a web information company, 67% of the requests made to Orkut come from Brazil, and more than 15% from India.For the last few years, Brazil has been seen as one of the most virus-ridden countries in the world. Brazilian virus writers are notorious for the thousands of different Trojans they’ve created to steal user data to bank accounts. Families such as Bancon, Banpaes and Banload are made up almost 100% of Trojans created in South America.Online banking is very popular in Brazil. Orkut is very popular in Brazil. There are lots of virus writers in Brazil. These three factors combine to result in one thing: the appearance of a worm which spreads via Orkut and steals account data to online banking systems.Out of all the social networking sites, Orkut has the longest list of malicious programs which target it. In 2006 and 2007 the site suffered from virus epidemics, and between 2005 and 2007, Orkut was the target of hacker attacks, and many vulnerabilities were detected. The most recent publicized incident was the appearance of a script worm in December 2007, when over 700,000 users ended up infected.A mere two months later, in February 2008, a new epidemic broke out. This time the hackers hadn’t bothered to search for or exploit XSS vulnerabilities on Orkut. The new worm functioned in accordance with relatively simple principles:It’s impossible to establish the exact number of victims, but our colleagues from Symantec estimate a minimum of 13,000 affected users.This incident shows once again how vulnerable users of social networking sites can be. The main factors which make Web 2.0 services popular with users and hackers alike are listed below:The problem has already become fairly serious, and stands every chance of becoming a major information security issue. We’ll be releasing a paper dedicated to this topic in the near future.The world of mobile virology was an eventful place in the first quarter of 2008. It was clear that technologies were continuing to evolve and more and more participants – both virus writers and antivirus companies – got involved. Innovations in terms of malicious code were split more or less evenly between the four targets of Symbian, Windows Mobile, J2ME and the iPhone .As far as Symbian goes, this operating system came under attack by the latest worm from a completely new family. Up until this point, we’d see two types of threat: Cabir, which spreads via Bluetooth, and ComWar, which spreads via MMS. Of course, there were several variants of both these worms.At the end of December, a program was added to our antivirus databases which at first glance seemed to simply be a new ComWar clone: ComWar.y. However, in January the appearance of this program in the traffic of one of the largest mobile operators forced us to take a more detailed look at the new sample.An analysis conducted by one of our partners, the Finnish company F-Secure, showed that in actual fact this malicious program was representative of a completely new family, which had nothing in common with ComWar, created three years ago in Russia.The worm, which was classified as Worm.SymbOS.Beselo.a (Beselo.b was detected shortly afterwards) functions in a way very similar to ComWar, and takes an approach typical for worms of this type. It spreads by sending infected SIS files via MMS and Bluetooth. Once the worm is launched on the device under attack, the worm starts to send itself to the contacts on the phone, and also to all accessible Bluetooth devices within range.What’s the news value in this? It’s the fact that there is a new, active family of worms for mobile devices (which implies the existence of active virus writers) and the presence of this worm in the wild. New variants of Beselo could cause serious local epidemics – this after all is what happened in spring last year, when 115,000 smartphone users fell victim to a Spanish modification of the ComWar worm.The appearance of a new malicious program for Windows Mobile, which hasn’t been a focus of attention for virus writers up until now, is certainly noteworthy. However, InfoJack, a Trojan which was detected at the end of February, is particularly interesting for the following reasons:InfoJack.aThis is the first malicious code targeting Windows Mobile which has been found in the wild and which has caused a significant number of infections. The code spread from a Chinese site which contained a range of types of legitimate software. The Trojan was added to mobile product distributives such as Google Maps and game clients. The owner of the site which the Trojan spread from stated that he did not have any illegal intentions, but was collecting information about the users of the site in order to improve the service and to analyze the market for mobile applications.Once it is on the system, the Trojan attempts to disable the protection mechanism which prevents the installation of applications which do not include a developer’s digital signature. When the infected smartphone is connected to the Internet, InfoJack starts to send confidential information from the device to the Trojan’s site. This information includes the device serial number, information about the operating system and installed applications. At the same time, the Trojan may download additional files to the phone without the knowledge of the user, and launch these files – it’s able to do this because protection against launching unsigned applications has been disabled.After a few days the activity of the site was halted, probably in connection with the investigation conducted by the Chinese police.This report has already covered what happens when virus writers turn their attention to popular services (e.g. the attacks on Orkut in Brazil). China is undoubtedly the world leader in terms of production of malicious code; at the moment, more than 50% of all new malicious programs in our antivirus databases originate in China.

Now that the first three months of the year have passed, we can start to draw some preliminary conclusions.Unfortunately, as often happens in the antivirus industry, the conclusions are fairly discouraging. The speed at which the number of malicious programs is rising continues to increase, with thousands of new variants being detected every day. This is starting to be accompanied by increased technical sophistication, and we are also seeing a shift in attack vectors, with malicious users starting to direct their attention to less well protected fields, such as Web 2.0 technologies and mobile devices.We continue to see the reincarnation of old ideas and techniques, and the implementation of these at new levels enhances the level of threat. Examples are infecting boot sectors on victim machines; spreading malicious programs via storage media, and infecting files.It looks as though the first quarter of 2008 brought the symbolic, but irrevocable death of the old school of virus writing. At the end of February, the site of the legendary 29A group officially announced that the group would cease to exist.The people who had created “Cap” (the first macro virus to cause a global epidemic), “Stream” (the first virus for additional NTFS streams), “Donut” (the first virus for the .NET platform), “Rugrat” (the first virus for the Win64 platform), the mobile viruses Cabir and Duts and many others, have now retreated, under pressure from the increased criminalization of the world of virus writers. No one creates malicious programs to express themselves, assert their personality or for research purposes anymore – it’s far more profitable to generate hundreds of primitive Trojan programs and then sell them.The death of 29A was commented on by nearly all the major antivirus companies: each company threw a virtual clod of earth on the grave of the group which in its time created many difficulties for virus analysts. So it’s fitting that we should also mention the event.As for what came to replace the ‘romantic’ ideal of virus writing in 2008, this is discussed in the following chapters:Bootkit rootkits – rootkits with the ability to boot from the boot sector of any device – became, de facto, the main problem for the antivirus industry at the start of 2008. Although the efforts made to combat this problem, and the seriousness of the issue may not have been obvious to the public at large, it may be that the subject will come to cause problems for everyone in the near future.It all started in November 2007, or perhaps, more correctly, in 2005. However, this isn’t totally correct either. Let’s take a quick trip into the past and recall what took place 22 years ago, in 1986.This is how the events of that year are described in the Virus Encyclopaedia on viruslist.com (http://www.viruslist.com/en/viruses/encyclopedia?chapter=153311030):The first global IBM-compatible virus epidemic was detected. Brain, which infected the boot sector, was able to spread practically worldwide within a few months. The almost total lack of awareness in the computing community of how to protect machines against viruses ensured Brain’s success. In fact, the appearance of numerous science fiction works on the topic only strengthened the panic, instead of teaching people about security.The Brain virus was written by a 19 year old Pakistani programmer, Basit Farooq Alvi, and his brother Amjad, and included a text string containing their names, address and telephone number. According to the virus’s authors, who worked in sales for a software company, they wanted to gauge the level of piracy in their country. Aside from infecting a disc’s boot sector and changing the disk name to ‘© Brain’, the virus did nothing; it had real payload, and did not corrupt data. Unfortunately, the brothers lost control of their so-called experiment and Brain spread worldwide.Interestingly enough, Brain was also the first ‘stealth virus.’ When an attempt to read the infected sector was detected, the virus would display the original, uninfected data.So this was the start of the story. For more than 10 years, boot viruses were one of the most widespread type of malicious programs.The principle on which these viruses work is relatively simple: they use algorithms which launch the operating system when the computer is switched on or rebooted. The system boot program reads the first physical sector of the boot disk (A:, C:, or the CD-ROM drive, depending on BIOS Setup parameters) and pass control to it. If there is a virus on the boot sector, the virus will gain control.There’s only one method known which is used to infect floppies: the virus replaces the original boot sector code on the disk with its own code. The hard drive can be infected in three different ways – the virus either replaces the MBR code with its own code; replaces the boot sector code on the boot disk (usually C:) with its own code, or modifies the address of the active boot sector in the Disk Partition Table located on the hard drive MBR.In the majority of cases, when infecting the disk the virus moves the original boot sector (or the MBR) to another disk sector (for instance, to the first free sector).Developers started adding protection to prevent the MBR from being written to. Windows 95/98 appeared, floppies started to disappear from use, and after almost a decade, boot sector viruses faded from the landscape, becoming part of the history of virology.However, at Black Hat USA in 2005, Derek Soeder and Ryan Permeh, two researchers from eEye Digital Security, presented BootRoot. This technology made it possible to place code on the boot sector of the disk – code that would intercept the booting of the Windows kernel and launch a backdoor, making it possible to remotely administer the machine via the local network.This work attracted a certain amount of attention, and it was soon emulated. In January 2006, John Hesman from Next-Generation Security Software announced that functions for managing the electricity supply of the computer (the so-called ACPI – Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) make it possible to create programs which implement rootkit functions that can be saved to the BIOS flash memory. Malicious code saved in this location (BIOS) is more difficult to detect than in the case of the boot backdoor. Hesman also created prototype code which makes it possible to increase system privileges and read data from the computer memory.A year later, at the end of 2007, two Indian programmers called Nitin and Vipin Kumar presented Vbootkit – a rootkit with a function making it capable of launching from the boot sector of any device. The program can also run on Windows Vista. The source code was not made public, but was passed to some antivirus companies.The main principle behind Vbootkit is shown below:The authors promised to implement BIOS infection in the next version of the bootkit.In other words, what came to pass was no surprise – old technology for infecting the boot sector was combined with the fashion for rootkits. In spite of the fact that nearly all antivirus companies today are able to scan the boot sector of disks, it’s still difficult to detect if system functions have been intercepted or substituted. And this is true even in the case of a Trojan and an antivirus running on one operating system, without even addressing a backdoor which starts before the operating system has launched.All of the above seems like a potentially explosive mixture that could go up at any moment. And the explosion came in November 2007, although news of this came slightly later, at the end of December, when several thousand users (there is no exact data on the number of infections) came under attack from the first malicious implementation of a bootkit.Between the 19th and the 28th December several websites appeared which used drive-by downloads (infecting a victim machine by placing exploits on a web site which then download a malicious program). A detailed analysis of the malicious program revealed code able to infect the MBR and hard disk sectors.Once on the victim machine, the malicious code modifies the MBR, writes the rootkit part to a disk sector, extracts a Windows backdoor from itself, installs the backdoor, and then deletes itself.When infecting the MBR, instructions pass control to the main part of the rootkit which is placed on several hard disk sectors and which is not represented as files in the system. This part monitors the already loaded Windows operating system and when reading, it hides the infected MBR and the “dirty” sectors by presenting clean ones instead. It does this by intercepting and substituting system functions.In addition to hiding its presence in the system, the malicious code installs a backdoor in Windows; the backdoor will steal user data, including user data to a range of online banking systems.A reconstruction of events based on the variants of the rootkits detected, analysis of the infected sites and the code of the malicious program downloaded from these sites showed that from November 2007, the unknown authors had been preparing to launch their code on the world. Several of the first variants of this malicious program stem from mid-November to mid-December; these are effectively alpha versions which contain serious errors in the code, and indicate that the authors were searching for optimal variants.The code released at the end of December was already relatively effective. We classified the malicious program, which combined the functions of a bootkit and a backdoor, as Backdoor.Win32.Sinowal. This was because many of the functions in the backdoor, and also the method used to ‘litter’ code were identical to those which we are familiar with in Trojan-PSW.Win32.Sinowal.In spite of increased sophistication and the many innovations implemented in the bootkit, it’s only able to protect itself – this leaves the backdoor file open to being detected and deleted. This indicates that different people were involved in developing the bootkit and the backdoor, and there are a number of reasons to suggest that the bootkit was created by virus writers from Russia. There are well known cases in which virus writers have worked together. However, the result in this case suggests a warrior who has been hastily dressed in another’s reforged armour which is, effectively, useless.Nevertheless, the bootkit appears to be a self-sufficient platform – something that could be added to any existing malicious program in order to protect that program and mask its presence in the system. It may be that bootkits for sale will appear in the near future, making the technology available to thousands of script kiddies. Taking into account the rate at which the number of malicious programs is increasing, this could become one of the most widespread threats.Why is it so difficult to protect against bootkits? The main problems are as follows:Of course, the best protection is to prevent the system from getting infected in the first place – after all, a bootkit doesn’t materialize out of thin air. It has to get onto the computer somehow. Some antivirus programs are able to prevent infection even by unknown variants of malicious programs. However, there is always the possibility that such protection can be penetrated, and this raises the question of how to disinfect an already infected machine.Here there are two options – either an antivirus is already installed on the system (in such cases, the four points mentioned above relate to the antivirus solution) or there is no antivirus, and one needs to be installed. In the second case, we encounter an additional problem related to that in point 1; the malicious code can block attempts to install an antivirus solution on the infected system.Virus writers have analysed how antivirus companies solve the problems listed above, and in February 2008, a new improved version of the bootkit was released. All the methods previously implemented to combat bootkits turned out to be useless.At the same time, the bootkit started spreading in new ways. Links to sites containing exploits which would install the bootkit were discovered on a number of European sites which had been hacked.So far, apart from Sinowal, we haven’t detected any other malicious programs which come equipped with a bootkit. At the moment, the standoff between antivirus companies and virus writers is following the classic path of attack and counter-attack. Even the latest variants of the bootkit can be combated without significant innovations in antivirus solutions.However, looking a couple of steps down the line it’s clear that sooner or later that only one method will guarantee that such malicious programs can be detected and deleted. This will entail a shift from software protection to hardware protection.The key question is what gains control first – if it’s the virus, then an antivirus will, a priori, be useless.So, viruses have (again) reached the MBR. 10 years ago we solved this problem by using a boot disk equipped with an antivirus. It may be that the time is coming when we’ll see the return of not just old virus technologies, but old antivirus technologies as well.Mid January 2008 marked the first anniversary of the appearance of the first samples of what would become known, variously, as Zhelatin, Nuwar or the Storm Worm. Until then, computer virology had not encountered such a vigorously and variedly evolving malicious program.Zhelatin continued to use and develope the concepts which had been implemented in the Bagle and Warezov worms. Zhelatin took its modular structure from Bagle, and copied Warezov in the frequent release of new variants. It also resembled Warezov in moving away from mass-mailing the main component via email, instead using hundreds of infected sites as well as Skype and IM to spread the malicious code. Added to all of this were social engineering tricks, rootkit technologies, methods for launching counter attacks on antivirus companies, and a decentralized botnet. In less than a year, the Storm Worm became the information security industry’s main problem, due to its almost mythical botnet.The exact dimensions of the Storm botnet remain a mystery. In 2007 we heard a widely varying range of estimates of the number of infected machines, and these estimates were all voiced around the same time. For instance, in September some experts estimated that the botnet had 2 million machines; others put the figure at between 250,000 and a million, while a third group believed the size to be 150,000 machines. There were even those who talked of 50 million infected computers! The reason for such a wide variety of figures is clear – because of the decentralized nature of the botnet, it’s impossible to establish the exact number of zombie machines. Estimates can only be made based on indirect indicators, which are of course debateable.Whichever way you look at it, the Storm botnet did exist. However, it was inactive. There was no ‘classic’ botnet activity detected; it wasn’t used for mass mailings, or to conduct DDoS attacks (which, incidentally, doesn’t rule out the botnet having been created by cybercriminal for criminal use). This left the impression that the botnet didn’t perform any function apart from spreading the Storm worm itself (it did this by sending new messages containing links to infected sites and then placing modules on the infected machines which would then be downloaded onto new victim machines). It really wasn’t clear why the botnet had been created: simply for the sake of it? But that doesn’t happen – botnets take far too many resources to create and maintain.Around October 2007, the frequency of mass mailings conducted by Zhelatin started to decline somewhat. Experts who had previously talked about millions of infected machines started to drop their estimates of the size of the botnet to between 150,000 and 200,000 computers. The suspicious emerged that the botnet was being prepared to be sold on in sections. Around the same time, the first mass mailings of spam from computers infected with the Storm Worm were detected. However, it couldn’t be stated conclusively that spam was being sent via the botnet, rather than via other malicious programs which might also be located on the victim machines.The end of 2007 and the early months of 2008 provided an answer to the question of what was happening with the Storm Worm.At Christmas, the worm reappeared. The botnet started sending out millions of messages with titles such as “Find Some Christmas Tail”, “Warm up this Christmas” and “Mrs. Clause Is Out Tonight!”. The messages were designed to entice the user to a site called merrychristmasdude.com, which contained exploits that would conduct a drive-by download to get the Storm Worm onto victim machines. In actual fact, merrychristmasdude.com wasn’t a single site which could have been closed down in order to prevent infection. Zhelatin used fast-flux, a technique for changing DNS addresses which constantly modifies the location of the site between more than a thousand deliberately prepared computers.Similar attacks, with only slight variations, carried on over the next few days, up until 15th January, when something strange happened. Either it was a joke on the part of the authors, or they simply made a mistake; whatever the case, the botnet started sending out messages containing Valentine’s cards, even though Valentine’s Day was still a month off.The messages had titles such as “Sent with Love”, “Our Love is Strong”, “Your Love Has Opened” and so on. Naturally, the messages led the user to the fast-flux site currently being used.The mass mailings in January turned out to be on a larger scale and also more intrusive than those which were conducted in the second half of 2007. They were also the largest mass mailings carried out in the first quarter of 2008. The authors of Zhelatin had struck a series of blows to either return the botnet to its original size or perhaps even to enlarge it. Computers infected by Zhelatin started to participate in DoS attacks, and MessageLabs started estimating that the Storm botnet was behind almost 20% of spam currently being sent out.At approximately the same time Fortinet announced it believed the botnet was part of phishing attacks launched against the Barclays and Halifax banks. If this is the case, then it is the first time the Storm botnet has been directly used for classic cybercrime aims.At the same time as the Storm Worm increased its activity, talk turned to the need to catch and sentence its authors. However, experts couldn’t agree on even the nationality of those behind the worm, never mind naming names.At the moment, there are two prevailing points of view. Dmitry Alperovitch from Secure Computing believes that a Russian is responsible, even going so far as to point to a location in St. Petersburg. He draws parallels with the notorious Russian Business Network (RBN) and the authors of the exploit bundle Mpack. Many experts support the view of the worm’s Russian origins.Others believe that the Storm Worm has been created by Americans. This argument is supported by the fact that the authors, in their use of social engineering tactics, demonstrate a suspiciously good knowledge of American life and psychology. The mass mailings play on specific incidents and events which will be of particular interest to the American public. And these events could well be unknown to virus writers from other countries, and particularly those from Russia.We do not have any information which supports one point of view or the other. It seems to us that one of the most likely scenarios is that an international group which has clearly defined responsibilities lies behind this activity. Someone creates the worm; someone else is responsible for mass mailings; someone else places the worm on the infected sites; someone else hacks the sites; someone else is responsible for spreading the malicious program via instant messaging, and finally, yet another person is responsible for creating the exploits.The widespread nature of the Storm Worm and the attack vectors which are being used are far too extensive to be within the capabilities of one, two or three people. If our suppositions are correct, then the Storm Worm is a text book example of modern cybercrime and its international distribution of labour. It is of course true that it is still unclear how the cybercriminals are making money using the Storm Worm.While we were still looking for the answers to the questions raised by the Storm Worm, at the end of March its authors sent out the latest flood of messages. The occasion – April 1st, known throughout the US, Europe and Russia as April Fool’s Day.The question remains: who will have the last laugh?Although incidents in which legitimate programs and software companies spread infection are relatively rare, they do exist in the information security world. Past cases have ranged from infected distributions to infected document files being sent to clients and partners.Every incident of this nature has a significant effect on the reputation either of the software or of the company concerned. They affect users who do observe the basic rules of computer security and cause problems for antivirus companies who view legitimate software and the sources it stems from as trustworthy.The first quarter of 2008 brought the latest case of this type.At the beginning of March, Kaspersky Lab analysts received messages from users saying that a Trojan was present in the directory of the popular download client FlashGet. Analysis showed that the problem affected users throughout the world. The symptoms of infection were the appearance of files called inapp4.exe, inapp5.exe and inapp6.exe in the system. Kaspersky Anti-Virus detected these files as Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.exo, Trojan-Dropper.Win32.Agent.ezo and Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.kht.It was a strange situation: no other Trojan program which could have got this Trojan onto the system was detected. Some of the victims had fully patched operating systems and browsers. So how could these malicious programs have penetrated the infected machines?What attracted our attention straight away was the location of the Trojans – in the FlashGet directory itself. A quick check showed that apart from the presence of the Trojan files, the FGUpdate3.ini file had recently been created and modified (the blue text shows the differences from the original file):The link to inapp4.exe (the Trojan file) led to the genuine FlashGet site: the Trojan would download from the site in the form of a file called appA.cab.There wasn’t any information about the incident on the FlashGet site, and a look at the user’s forum returned a lot of messages about both about infections, and the fact that the developers were remaining silent on this matter.Information found on the Internet showed that the first cases of infection had been detected back on 29th February. The most recent infection that we knew of at that time had been on 9th March. For ten days, a legitimate program had been acting as a Trojan downloader program, installing and launching Trojan programs placed on the developers’ site on victim machines.It might have seemed that the incident was over – when we published information about this case, the Trojans had already been deleted from the site, and the FGUpdate3.ini file (which is also downloaded from the Internet) had been reverted to its original condition. However, in less than two weeks, on 22nd March, Steve Bass, the editor of the popular publication PC World, detected Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Agent.kht in his FlashGet directory. It looked as though history was repeating itself – both the FlashGet site and the program itself were once again spreading malicious code.We can see two ways in which FlashGet could be transformed into a Trojan downloader program.The first is the most obvious explanation – the site itself was hacked. As a result, a malicious user would be able to replace the standard configuration file with a file that would lead to the Trojan placed on the site. We don’t know why the hackers didn’t use a different site – it might be that they worked on the principle that hiding in plain view (e.g. a link to the FlashGet file in the configuration file would not raise suspicions) would be the best disguise.We decided to check if it would be possible to use this trick to download any other files from any other sites. The answer: yes. All you need to do is add a link to the FGUpdate3.ini file. And that link can lead to anything, which will then be automatically downloaded and launched on your computer each time FlashGet is launched. Even if you don’t press “Refresh”, FlashGet will independently use the information from the .ini file.The ‘vulnerability’ is present in all versions of FlashGet 1.9.xx. This means that even though the hack of the FlashGet site has been fixed, the vulnerability in the user’s system remains. Any Trojan program can modify the local FlashGet .ini file, making it act as a Trojan downloader. And it’s this method which is the second of the two mentioned above.Is there any need to stress the fact that FlashGet is usually treated as a trusted application, and that any network activity generated by the program is seen as legitimate, as well as contacting any sites?There has, to date, been no official reaction from the Chinese company which develops FlashGet. The true cause of the incident remains unknown, and there is no guarantee that it will not happen again. You can draw your own conclusions…Antivirus companies retain the right to decide whether or not FlashGet is potentially malicious, and have started to classify it as Riskware. There are more than enough grounds for doing so.We wrote about the danger caused by social networking sites in our annual report. We forecast that in 2008 users of social networking sites will become the main targets for phishing attacks. There will start to be increased demand among malicious users for account data to services such as Facebook, MySpace, LiveJournal, Blogger and others. This will become a dangerous alternative to placing malicious programs on hacked sites. In 2008, many Trojan programs will spread via user accounts on social networking sites, on their blogs and on their profiles.February 2008 met these expectations in full. Once again Orkut, the popular social networking site owned by Google, came under attack.Orkut is extremely popular in a number of countries through the world, and particularly in Brazil and India. According to data provided by Alexa.com, a web information company, 67% of the requests made to Orkut come from Brazil, and more than 15% from India.For the last few years, Brazil has been seen as one of the most virus-ridden countries in the world. Brazilian virus writers are notorious for the thousands of different Trojans they’ve created to steal user data to bank accounts. Families such as Bancon, Banpaes and Banload are made up almost 100% of Trojans created in South America.Online banking is very popular in Brazil. Orkut is very popular in Brazil. There are lots of virus writers in Brazil. These three factors combine to result in one thing: the appearance of a worm which spreads via Orkut and steals account data to online banking systems.Out of all the social networking sites, Orkut has the longest list of malicious programs which target it. In 2006 and 2007 the site suffered from virus epidemics, and between 2005 and 2007, Orkut was the target of hacker attacks, and many vulnerabilities were detected. The most recent publicized incident was the appearance of a script worm in December 2007, when over 700,000 users ended up infected.A mere two months later, in February 2008, a new epidemic broke out. This time the hackers hadn’t bothered to search for or exploit XSS vulnerabilities on Orkut. The new worm functioned in accordance with relatively simple principles:It’s impossible to establish the exact number of victims, but our colleagues from Symantec estimate a minimum of 13,000 affected users.This incident shows once again how vulnerable users of social networking sites can be. The main factors which make Web 2.0 services popular with users and hackers alike are listed below:The problem has already become fairly serious, and stands every chance of becoming a major information security issue. We’ll be releasing a paper dedicated to this topic in the near future.The world of mobile virology was an eventful place in the first quarter of 2008. It was clear that technologies were continuing to evolve and more and more participants – both virus writers and antivirus companies – got involved. Innovations in terms of malicious code were split more or less evenly between the four targets of Symbian, Windows Mobile, J2ME and the iPhone .As far as Symbian goes, this operating system came under attack by the latest worm from a completely new family. Up until this point, we’d see two types of threat: Cabir, which spreads via Bluetooth, and ComWar, which spreads via MMS. Of course, there were several variants of both these worms.At the end of December, a program was added to our antivirus databases which at first glance seemed to simply be a new ComWar clone: ComWar.y. However, in January the appearance of this program in the traffic of one of the largest mobile operators forced us to take a more detailed look at the new sample.An analysis conducted by one of our partners, the Finnish company F-Secure, showed that in actual fact this malicious program was representative of a completely new family, which had nothing in common with ComWar, created three years ago in Russia.The worm, which was classified as Worm.SymbOS.Beselo.a (Beselo.b was detected shortly afterwards) functions in a way very similar to ComWar, and takes an approach typical for worms of this type. It spreads by sending infected SIS files via MMS and Bluetooth. Once the worm is launched on the device under attack, the worm starts to send itself to the contacts on the phone, and also to all accessible Bluetooth devices within range.What’s the news value in this? It’s the fact that there is a new, active family of worms for mobile devices (which implies the existence of active virus writers) and the presence of this worm in the wild. New variants of Beselo could cause serious local epidemics – this after all is what happened in spring last year, when 115,000 smartphone users fell victim to a Spanish modification of the ComWar worm.The appearance of a new malicious program for Windows Mobile, which hasn’t been a focus of attention for virus writers up until now, is certainly noteworthy. However, InfoJack, a Trojan which was detected at the end of February, is particularly interesting for the following reasons:InfoJack.aThis is the first malicious code targeting Windows Mobile which has been found in the wild and which has caused a significant number of infections. The code spread from a Chinese site which contained a range of types of legitimate software. The Trojan was added to mobile product distributives such as Google Maps and game clients. The owner of the site which the Trojan spread from stated that he did not have any illegal intentions, but was collecting information about the users of the site in order to improve the service and to analyze the market for mobile applications.Once it is on the system, the Trojan attempts to disable the protection mechanism which prevents the installation of applications which do not include a developer’s digital signature. When the infected smartphone is connected to the Internet, InfoJack starts to send confidential information from the device to the Trojan’s site. This information includes the device serial number, information about the operating system and installed applications. At the same time, the Trojan may download additional files to the phone without the knowledge of the user, and launch these files – it’s able to do this because protection against launching unsigned applications has been disabled.After a few days the activity of the site was halted, probably in connection with the investigation conducted by the Chinese police.This report has already covered what happens when virus writers turn their attention to popular services (e.g. the attacks on Orkut in Brazil). China is undoubtedly the world leader in terms of production of malicious code; at the moment, more than 50% of all new malicious programs in our antivirus databases originate in China.

"Several new versions of PHP have been released, all of which contain a number of bug fixes, most notably a patch for the so-called BACKRONYM vulnerability in MySQL. That bug in MySQL is caused by a problem with the way that the database software handles requests for secure connections. Researchers at Duo Security disclosed the vulnerability back in April after they noticed that MySQL was exhibited some weird behavior, namely an inability to enforce the use of SSL. The end result is that an attacker could force a client to send information over plaintext TCP rather than SSL. “The most serious risk is posed by adversaries with passive monitoring capabilities like the NSA, intelligence agencies, or other capable attackers who may have a foothold on your network. Many MySQL clients will use a DNS hostname (eg. db1.app.company.com) to connect to the database server, triggering a DNS query that may traverse monitored links on the Internet. A global passive adversary like the NSA can spoof a reply to this DNS request in order to hijack the MySQL connection, perform the downgrade, and steal/manipulate database contents,” the Duo researchers said in an FAQ on the BACKRONYM bug. The PHP Group fixed this vulnerability in versions 5.6.11, 5.5.27, and 5.4.43. In addition to those releases, the group also released the beta of version 7.0.0.

"The National Football League’s NFL Mobile application leaks unencrypted credentials putting personal user information at risk. Update – As if the National Football League doesn’t have enough to worry about during Super Bowl week with deflated footballs and cheating allegations marring its most important event, a security firm has found a glaring vulnerability in its mobile application. Just in time for the big game, NFL Mobile apparently leaks user profile data via a secondary API call that is not encrypted. Researchers at Wandera, a mobile data gateway provider, said that once a user signs in to the NFL Mobile app, the user’s credentials are sent in the clear in a secondary, unencrypted API call. The username and user’s email address were also found in an unencrypted cookie that’s created upon login and used in subsequent calls made by the mobile application to different NFL.com domains. A Wandera spokeperson told Threatpost that the NFL was notified last Monday and has yet to reply. “With these credentials, an attacker can access the user’s full NFL profile at [NFL.com],” Wandera said in a statement. “This profile page is unencrypted as well, so the registered personal data is also vulnerable to man-in-the-middle intercept. “It is unclear whether any credit card information would also be visible, as Wandera’s security team did not attempt to purchase any NFL Merchandise during the review,” the company added. The National Football League reached out to Threatpost on Wednesday and said the vulnerability has been addressed. “We continuously monitor and evaluate our systems for any security issues and remediate them as quickly as possible,” said an NFL Media spokesperson. Using these credentials, an attacker can snag a user’s full name, address, phone number, date of birth and other data that could contribute to identity theft and attacks against social media accounts if credentials are re-used. Wandera CEO Eldar Tuvey said 23 percent of the company’s customers in the United States have an employee using the app. Given the Super Bowl is Sunday, traffic via the app and NFL.com domains figures to grow exponentially the rest of the week, as will the risk for compromise right along with it. “A very high percentage of users reuse passwords across multiple accounts, so the email/password combination for NFL Mobile may also be the same as those used to access sensitive corporate data, banking sites, or other high value targets,” Tuvey cautioned. “Moreover, date-of-birth, name, address and phone number are the exact building blocks required to initiate a successful identity theft from the NFL fans.” The NFL Mobile user’s credentials are sent in the clear in a secondary, unencrypted API call. Tweet Mobile applications are a continuous sore spot with security experts. They’re often a hacker’s easiest route to compromising a user’s credentials or data, rather than attacking the mobile device itself. Apps are also criticized for requesting excessive permissions, putting user privacy further at risk. According to the results of a study conducted by the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), most of the top 50 download mobile apps are greedy in request access to other services on the device, or personal user data stored on the device. Most apps (85 percent) do not explain in clear language to users what information is collected, how it’s collected, nor how it’s used and disclosed. More than one-third, meanwhile, ask for excessive permissions such as access to the phone’s location data, device ID, camera, microphone, contacts and more. The availability and simple access to a privacy policy is also absent in most cases.

They’re often a hacker’s easiest route to compromising a user’s credentials or data, rather than attacking the mobile device itself. Apps are also criticized for requesting excessive permissions, putting user privacy further at risk. According to the results of a study conducted by the U.K.’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), most of the top 50 download mobile apps are greedy in request access to other services on the device, or personal user data stored on the device. Most apps (85 percent) do not explain in clear language to users what information is collected, how it’s collected, nor how it’s used and disclosed. More than one-third, meanwhile, ask for excessive permissions such as access to the phone’s location data, device ID, camera, microphone, contacts and more. The availability and simple access to a privacy policy is also absent in most cases.

"Evernote’s web clipper extension for Chrome is vulnerable to a critical flaw that could have exposed the data of more than 4.6 million users. UPDATE A critical flaw in the popular note-taking Evernote extension could have allowed attackers to steal personal data – including emails and financial transactions – of millions. Specifically impacted was the Evernote Web Clipper extension for the Chrome browser, which lets users capture full-page article, images, selected text, emails and more. The Evernote extension is extremely popular, putting the personal data of than 4.6 million users at risk, researchers said. “Upon successful exploitation, a visit to a hacker-controlled website would compromise the visitor’s private data from affected 3rd-party websites,” researchers with Gaurdio, who discovered the flaw, said in an analysis this week. “In their Proof-of-Concept (PoC), Guardio has demonstrated access to Social media (reading and posting content), Financial transaction history, private shopping lists, and more.” Researchers disclosed the flaw to Evernote on May 27; a fix was confirmed on June 4. Evernote users are urged to update to version 7.11.1 or later. “At Evernote, we have not found any evidence that the vulnerability reported by Guardio has been exploited and Guardio does not believe that anyone took advantage of the bug,” an Evernote spokesperson told Threatpost. “We have a robust security program which includes working with many external security researchers; when we or a third-party discover vulnerabilities, we have a formal triage process that ensures that we appropriately prioritize and resolve/mitigate the vulnerability,” the spokesperson said. “In this case, due to the potential impact, we had patched the vulnerability and distributed a new release within 3 days of Guardio’s contacting us.” The Vulnerability In order to enable the Evernote extension’s functionalities (such as highlighting or screenshotting the content of websites), a file is injected into web pages that use the extension. However, a logical coding error (CVE-2019-12592) left a function – used to provide a valid URL from the site to the extension’s namespace – unsanitized. That means that attackers could inject their own script into the webpage – granting them access to sensitive user information. “The exploit is triggered by the malicious website and causes Evernote’s internal infrastructure to inject an attacker controlled payload into all iframes contexts,” researchers said. In a proof of concept video (below), researchers broke down how an attacker might exploit the flaw. A user first must be persuaded to go to the attacker’s malicious website, perhaps from an email or social media link. That malicious website then silently loads hidden, legitimate iframe tags of targeted websites. An iframe tag is an HTML document embedded inside another HTML document on a website. These iframe tags have injected payload customized for each targeted website, that could steal cookies, credentials, private information, perform actions as the user and more, researchers said. Evernote has faced security incidents over the years, saying in 2013 that attackers had compromised user information like email addresses and hashed passwords. And in 2014, Evernote fell victim to a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that shut down the service for hours.

"Statistics Download the full report (PDF)Targeted attack campaigns don’t need to be technically advanced in order to be successful. In July 2016 we reported on a group called Dropping Elephant (also known as ‘Chinastrats’ and ‘Patchwork’). Using a combination of social engineering, old exploit code and some PowerShell-based malware this group was able to steal sensitive data from its victims.This group, which has been active since November 2015, targets high profile diplomatic and economic organizations linked to China’s foreign relations – an interest that is evident from the themes the attackers use to trap their victims.The attackers use a combination of spear-phishing e-mails and watering-hole attacks. The first involves sending a document with remote content. When the victim opens the document, a ping request is sent to the attackers’ Command-and-Control (C2) server. The victim then receives a second spear-phishing e-mail, containing either a Word document or a PowerPoint file (these exploit old vulnerabilities – CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2014-6352 respectively). Once the payload has been executed, a UPX-packed AutoIT executable is dropped on to the system: once executed, this downloads further components from the C2 server and the theft of data from the victim’s computer begins.In Q3 2016, @kaspersky repelled 172m malicious attacks via online resources located in 191 countries #KLreport #InfosecThe attackers also created a watering-hole website that downloads genuine news articles from legitimate websites. If a visitor wants to view the whole article, they are prompted to download a PowerPoint file: this reveals the rest of the document, but also asks the victim to download a malicious object. The attackers sometimes e-mail links to their watering-hole website. In addition, they maintain Google+, Facebook and Twitter accounts, to develop relevant search engine optimization (SEO) and to reach out to wider targets.The success of the Dropping Elephant group is striking given that no zero-day exploits or advanced techniques were used to target high-profile victims – it’s clear that by applying security updates and improving the security awareness of staff, the success of attacks like this can be prevented. At the start of the year we predicted that APT groups would invest less effort in developing sophisticated tools and make greater use of off-the-shelf malware. Dropping Elephant provides a further example of how low investment and use of ready-made toolsets can be very effective when combined with high quality social engineering.In September, our Anti-Targeted Attack Platform flagged an anomaly in the network of a customer’s organization. Further investigation led us to uncover ProjectSauron, a group that has been stealing confidential data from organizations in Russia, Iran and Rwanda – and probably other countries – since June 2011. We have identified more than 30 victims: the target organizations all play a key role in providing state services and come from government, military, scientific research, telecommunications and financial sectors.ProjectSauron is particularly focused on obtaining access to encrypted communications, hunting for them using an advanced, modular cyber-espionage platform that incorporates a set of unique tools and techniques. The cost, complexity, persistence and the ultimate goal of the operation (i.e. stealing secret data from state-related organizations) suggest that ProjectSauron is a state-sponsored campaign. ProjectSauron gives the impression of an experienced threat group that has made a considerable effort to learn from other highly advanced attacks, including Duqu, Flame, Equation and Regin – adopting some of their most innovative techniques and improving on their tactics in order to remain undiscovered.One of the most noteworthy features of ProjectSauron is the deliberate avoidance of patterns: the implants used by the group are customized for each victim and are never re-used. This makes the use of traditional Indicators of Compromise (IoC) almost useless. This approach, along with the use of multiple routes for the exfiltration of stolen data (such as legitimate e-mail channels and DNS) enables ProjectSauron to conduct well-hidden, long-term spying campaigns in targeted networks.Key features of ProjectSauron:The method used to initially infect victims remains unknown.The single use of unique methods, such as control server, encryption keys and more, in addition to the adoption of cutting-edge techniques from other major threats groups, is new. The only effective way to withstand such threats is to deploy multiple layers of security, with sensors to monitor for even the slightest anomaly in organizational workflow, combined with threat intelligence and forensic analysis. You can find further discussion of the methods available to deal with such threats here.In August, a person or group going under the name ‘ShadowBrokers’ claimed to possess files belonging to the Equation group. They provided links to two PGP encrypted archives. They provided the password to the first for free, but ‘auctioned’ the second, setting the price at 1 million BTC (1/15th of the bitcoins in circulation).Having uncovered the Equation group in February 2015, we were interested in examining the first archive. It contains almost 300MB of firewall exploits, tools and scripts, under cryptonyms such as BANANAUSURPER, BLATSTING and BUZZDIRECTION. Most of the files are at least three years old, with change entries pointing to August 2013 and the newest time-stamp dating to October 2013.The Equation group makes extensive use of RC5 and RC6 encryption algorithms (these algorithms were designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 and 1998 respectively). The free trove provided by ShadowBrokers includes 347 different instances of RC5 and RC6 implementations. The implementation is functionally identical with that found in the Equation malware – and has not been seen elsewhere.The code similarity makes us believe with a high degree of confidence that the tools from the ShadowBrokers leak are related to the malware from the Equation group.In June, we noticed a wave of spear-phishing e-mails with malicious attachments. The messages, sent mainly to top and middle level managers of numerous companies, appeared to be coming from a bank in the UAE. The messages claimed to offer payment advice from the bank and included an attached SWIFT document. But the archive really contained malware. Further investigation revealed that the June attacks were the most recent operation of a group that researchers had been tracking for more than a year, named Operation Ghoul by Kaspersky Lab.The group successfully attacked more than 130 organizations from 30 countries, including Spain, Pakistan, UAE, India, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany and Saudi Arabia. Based on information obtained from the sink-hole of some C2 servers, the majority of the target organizations work in the industrial and engineering sectors. Others include shipping, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, trading and educational organizations.The malware used by the Operation Ghoul group is based on the commercial spyware kit Hawkeye, sold openly on the Dark Web. Once installed, the malware collects interesting data from the victim’s computer, including keystrokes, clipboard data, FTP server credentials, account data from browsers, messaging clients, e-mail clients and information about installed applications. This data is sent to the group’s C2 servers.The aim of the campaign seems to be financial profit – all the targeted organizations hold valuable data that can be sold on the black market.The continued success of social engineering as a way of gaining a foothold in target organizations highlights the need for businesses to make staff awareness and education a central component of their security strategy.In June 2016 we reported on the Lurk banking Trojan, used to systematically siphon money from the accounts of commercial organizations in Russia – among them, a number of banks. The police estimate the losses caused by this Trojan at around $45 million.During our research into this Trojan, it became apparent that victims of Lurk had also installed the remote administration software, Ammyy Admin. While we didn’t give it much thought at first, it became apparent that the official Ammyy Admin website had been compromised and was being used by the Lurk gang as part of a watering-hole attack: the Trojan was downloaded to victim’s computers along with the legitimate software.The dropper on the Ammyy Admin site started distributing a different Trojan on 1 June 2016, ‘Trojan-PSW.Win32.Fareit’: this was the day that the alleged creators of the Lurk Trojan were arrested. It seems that those responsible for the Ammyy Admin website breach were happy to sell their Trojan dropper to anyone who wanted to distribute malware from the compromised site.The banking Trojan wasn’t the only cybercriminal activity the Lurk group was involved in. The group also developed the Angler exploit kit, a set of malicious programs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in widespread software to install malware. This exploit kit was originally developed to provide a reliable and effective delivery channel for the group’s malware. However, in 2013 the group started to rent out the kit to anyone who was willing to pay for it – probably to help pay for the group’s huge network infrastructure and large number of ‘staff’. The Angler exploit kit became one of the most powerful tools available on the criminal underground. Unlike the Lurk banking Trojan, which focused on victims in Russia, Angler has been used by attackers across the world – including the groups behind the CryptXXX and TeslaCrypt ransomware and the Neverquest banking Trojan (the latter was used against almost 100 banks). The operations of Angler were disrupted after the arrest of the alleged members of the Lurk group.In Q3 2016, 45.2M unique malicious URLs were recognized by @kaspersky web antivirus components #KLreport #ITThe group was involved in other side activities too. For more than five years, the group moved from developing very powerful malware for automated money theft with Remote Banking Services software, to sophisticated theft involving SIM-card swap fraud, to becoming hacking specialists familiar with the internal infrastructure of banks.Kaspersky Lab provided assistance to the Russian police in the investigation into the group behind the Lurk Trojan. The arrests marked the culmination of a six-year investigation by our Computer Incidents Investigation Team. You can read about the investigation here.Hardly a month goes by without reports of ransomware attacks in the media: for example, a recent report suggested that 28 NHS trusts in the UK have fallen victim to ransomware in the last 12 months. Most ransomware attacks are directed at consumers, but a significant proportion target businesses (around 13 per cent in 2015-16). The Kaspersky Lab IT Security Risks Survey 2016 indicated that around 42 per cent of small and medium businesses became victims of ransomware in the 12 months up to August 2016.One recent ransomware campaign demanded a massive two bitcoins (around $1,300) as a ransom. The ransomware program, named Ded Cryptor, changes the wallpaper on the victim’s computer to a picture of an evil-looking Santa Claus.The modus operandi of this program (i.e. encrypted files, scary image, and ransom demand) is unremarkable, but the pre-history of this attack is interesting. It is based on the EDA2 open-source ransomware code, developed by Utku Sen as part of a failed experiment. Utku Sen, a security expert from Turkey, created a ransomware program and published the code online. He realized that cybercriminals would use the code to create their own cryptors, but hoped that this would help security researchers to understand how cybercriminals think and code, thereby making their own efforts to block ransomware more effective.Ded Cryptor was just one of many ransomware programs spawned by EDA2. Another such program that we saw recently was Fantom. This was interesting not just because of its connection to EDA2, but because it simulates a genuine-looking Windows update screenThis is displayed while Fantom is encrypting the victim’s files in the background. The fake update program runs in full-screen mode, visually blocking access to other programs and distracting the victim from what’s really happening. Once the encryption has been completed, Fantom displays a more typical message.There’s no doubt that public awareness of the problem is growing, but it’s clear that consumers and organizations alike are not doing enough to combat the threat; and cybercriminals are capitalising on this – this is clearly reflected in the growing number of ransomware attacks.It’s important to reduce your exposure to ransomware (and we’ve outlined important steps you can take here and here). However, there’s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it’s also important to mitigate the risk. In particular, it’s vital to ensure that you have a backup, to avoid facing a situation where the only choices are to pay the cybercriminals or lose your data. It’s never advisable to pay the ransom.In Q3 2016, @kaspersky web #antivirus detected 12,657,673 unique malicious objects #KLreport #netsecIf you do find yourself in a situation where your files are encrypted and you don’t have a backup, ask your anti-malware vendor if they can help and check the No More Ransom website, to see if it holds the keys to decrypt your data. This is a joint initiative by the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Kaspersky Lab and Intel Security – designed to help victims of ransomware retrieve their encrypted data without paying cybercriminals.In a recent ‘ask the expert‘ session, Jornt van der Wiel, an expert from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, provided useful insights into ransomware.Personal information is a valuable commodity, so it’s no surprise that cybercriminals target online providers, looking for ways to bulk-steal data in a single attack. We’ve become accustomed to the steady stream of security breaches reported in the media. This quarter has been no exception, with data leaks from the official forum of DotA 2, Yahoo and others.Some of these attacks resulted in the theft of huge amounts of data, highlighting the fact that many companies are failing to take adequate steps to defend themselves. Any organization that holds personal data has a duty of care to secure it effectively. This includes hashing and salting customer passwords and encrypting other sensitive data.Consumers can limit the damage of a security breach at an online provider by ensuring that they choose passwords that are unique and complex: an ideal password is at least 15 characters long and consists of a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols from the entire keyboard. As an alternative, people can use a password manager application to handle all this for them automatically.It’s also a good idea to use two-factor authentication, where an online provider offers this feature – requiring customers to enter a code generated by a hardware token, or one sent to a mobile device, in order to access a site, or at least in order to make changes to account settings.Given the potential impact of a security breach, it’s hardly surprising to see regulatory authorities paying closer attention to the issue. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) recently issued a record fine of £400,000 to Talk Talk for the company’s ‘failure to implement the most basic cyber security measures’, related to the attack on the company in October 2015. In the view of the ICO, the record fine ‘acts as a warning to others that cyber security is not an IT issue, it is a boardroom issue’.The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May 2018, will require companies to notify the regulator of data breaches, with significant fines for failure to secure personal data. You can find an overview of the regulation here.We took a look back at the impact of the Ashley Madison breach, one year after the attack that led to the leak of customer data, offering some good tips to anyone who might be considering looking online for love (and good advice for managing any online account).","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,T1021 Remote Services,T1047 Windows Management Instrumentation,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion","<s>[INST] Statistics Download the full report (PDF)Targeted attack campaigns don’t need to be technically advanced in order to be successful.

It is based on the EDA2 open-source ransomware code, developed by Utku Sen as part of a failed experiment. Utku Sen, a security expert from Turkey, created a ransomware program and published the code online. He realized that cybercriminals would use the code to create their own cryptors, but hoped that this would help security researchers to understand how cybercriminals think and code, thereby making their own efforts to block ransomware more effective.Ded Cryptor was just one of many ransomware programs spawned by EDA2. Another such program that we saw recently was Fantom. This was interesting not just because of its connection to EDA2, but because it simulates a genuine-looking Windows update screenThis is displayed while Fantom is encrypting the victim’s files in the background. The fake update program runs in full-screen mode, visually blocking access to other programs and distracting the victim from what’s really happening. Once the encryption has been completed, Fantom displays a more typical message.There’s no doubt that public awareness of the problem is growing, but it’s clear that consumers and organizations alike are not doing enough to combat the threat; and cybercriminals are capitalising on this – this is clearly reflected in the growing number of ransomware attacks.It’s important to reduce your exposure to ransomware (and we’ve outlined important steps you can take here and here). However, there’s no such thing as 100 per cent security, so it’s also important to mitigate the risk. In particular, it’s vital to ensure that you have a backup, to avoid facing a situation where the only choices are to pay the cybercriminals or lose your data. It’s never advisable to pay the ransom.In Q3 2016, @kaspersky web #antivirus detected 12,657,673 unique malicious objects #KLreport #netsecIf you do find yourself in a situation where your files are encrypted and you don’t have a backup, ask your anti-malware vendor if they can help and check the No More Ransom website, to see if it holds the keys to decrypt your data. This is a joint initiative by the National High Tech Crime Unit of the Netherlands’ police, Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre, Kaspersky Lab and Intel Security – designed to help victims of ransomware retrieve their encrypted data without paying cybercriminals.In a recent ‘ask the expert‘ session, Jornt van der Wiel, an expert from Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, provided useful insights into ransomware.Personal information is a valuable commodity, so it’s no surprise that cybercriminals target online providers, looking for ways to bulk-steal data in a single attack. We’ve become accustomed to the steady stream of security breaches reported in the media. This quarter has been no exception, with data leaks from the official forum of DotA 2, Yahoo and others.Some of these attacks resulted in the theft of huge amounts of data, highlighting the fact that many companies are failing to take adequate steps to defend themselves. Any organization that holds personal data has a duty of care to secure it effectively. This includes hashing and salting customer passwords and encrypting other sensitive data.Consumers can limit the damage of a security breach at an online provider by ensuring that they choose passwords that are unique and complex: an ideal password is at least 15 characters long and consists of a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols from the entire keyboard. As an alternative, people can use a password manager application to handle all this for them automatically.It’s also a good idea to use two-factor authentication, where an online provider offers this feature – requiring customers to enter a code generated by a hardware token, or one sent to a mobile device, in order to access a site, or at least in order to make changes to account settings.Given the potential impact of a security breach, it’s hardly surprising to see regulatory authorities paying closer attention to the issue. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) recently issued a record fine of £400,000 to Talk Talk for the company’s ‘failure to implement the most basic cyber security measures’, related to the attack on the company in October 2015. In the view of the ICO, the record fine ‘acts as a warning to others that cyber security is not an IT issue, it is a boardroom issue’.The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force in May 2018, will require companies to notify the regulator of data breaches, with significant fines for failure to secure personal data. You can find an overview of the regulation here.We took a look back at the impact of the Ashley Madison breach, one year after the attack that led to the leak of customer data, offering some good tips to anyone who might be considering looking online for love (and good advice for managing any online account).

"Reading Time: 3 minutes Learn how Comodo can help you for free if any of your information is already for sale on the Dark Web. As companies scramble to find the best ways to protect themselves from ransomware and other types of malware and with almost daily reports of major breaches and infiltrations, public awareness of cybersecurity may be at an all-time high…and yet, there are still some very basic, and easy to correct, mistakes being made that put companies at risk for major data loss. One major threat that has IT security personnel on high alert is known as “pony” malware. Basically a Russian password thief, this type of malware performs data exfiltration on the credentials of more than 90 applications once gaining access to a machine. Large companies, as a whole, are typically more vulnerable to these zero-day “pony” malware attacks, simply on a percentage-basis because there are more employees accessing more sites, both personal and professional. But enterprises are also more likely to be targeted because there is more for the black hats to gain, compared to hacking smaller organizations. According to Ponemon Institute, in 2016, a single stolen record cost companies $158. Data breaches overall, however, set companies back approximately $4 million, on average. Black hat hackers don’t care if they hurt your organization, as your stolen data becomes their revenue source on the Dark Web—but you should. Imagine a free report that can allay your fears and provide you with specifics about the areas of vulnerability for your company. Well, look no further. Comodo is offering a no-cost Company Threat Analysis report specifically to enterprises, companies with 1,000+ employees. This report shows in detail the kinds of data from companies and employees that is vulnerable to this kind of malware—and what is being sold on the Dark Web. Enterprises in all sectors have been shocked to discover the amount of information from their organization that is currently available for sale on the Dark Web. What stands out as a vulnerability, from a brute force perspective, is the simplicity of it all. As the Threat Analysis report has clearly shown our researchers, many of us are not very vigilant about our passwords. It is normal for many people to use the same password for multiple devices and accounts, or to only change them slightly, by adding a “1” – very common – or a symbol, usually “!” – also very common. Even when prompted to update or change them, many times we just move to the next number or next symbol. Often we use the names and birthdates of our children, spouses or other family members, simply updating their age as our new number each year. All of these password “strategies” are easily breached, by using brute force, simply trying the next most logical, simple password upgrade. For example, if I have a password that is “Nancy1,” when it is time to upgrade, if I’m like a large contingent of the population, I’ll simply go with “Nancy2” or “Nancy1!.” We have to be concerned about this not just on a personal level, but at a business level. If someone in my company is using this strategy, it not only puts their accounts at risk, it puts my business at risk. So what does this mean? How can you determine if your company is at risk? The best way to see what is vulnerable, to find out if there is already any information available for sale on the Dark Web, is to sign up for a Company Threat Analysis. Comodo’s personalized threat reports identify if an enterprise’s information has been stolen and dive into how this data became available to cybercriminals in the first place—for example, via credentials stolen from direct network access or data breaches from third-party applications. For each instance, the affected company gets the chance to review a sample of the leaked credential records and details on the attack processes, to help them understand what went wrong.

Apache has released version 2.4.9 of its ubiquitous HTTP web server (HTTPD), resolving two security vulnerabilities and a number of other bugs in the process. The Apache Software Foundation is recommending HTTPD 2.4.9 over all previous versions. The first patch fixes CVE-2014-0098. It aims to mitigate a cookie logging issue by accepting fewer redundant string parsing passes. In its latest iteration, Apache will log only cookies containing value assignments. Valueless cookies will be ignored. In all, the new version will prevent segmentation faults when logging truncated cookies. The second security bulletin closes off CVE-2013-6438, which – on unpatched systems – could potentially enable a denial of service condition. The bug existed in mod_dav, Apache’s Web distributed authoring and versioning module. The fix will do a better job of properly monitoring the length of character data while removing leading spaces. Ultimately, the fix should eliminate the DoS risk posed by specially crafted DAV write requests in prior versions.

"Google has fixed a security vulnerability in it’s cloud storage service, Drive, which could have leaked sensitive data to third parties. Google has fixed a vulnerability in its Drive cloud storage service that could have exposed certain information about shared links under a particular set of circumstances. Users will need to delete and re-upload relevant files shared on Google Drive in the past in order to limit exposure. The vulnerability could only be triggered if a Google Drive user were uploading a shared file in its original format, without converting it to Google’s Docs, Sheets, or Slides format. Furthermore, the owner would need to have changed the document’s sharing settings from the default so that it were visible “to anyone with the link.” The final criterion requires that that file or document contain an HTTPS link or links leading to third party sites. Given these conditions, when a user follows an HTTPS link in the document, the administrator of the site referred to by the link would receive header information allowing him or her to see the URL of the original document. “Today’s update to Drive takes extra precaution by ensuring that newly shared documents with hyperlinks to third-party HTTPS websites will not inadvertently relay the original document’s URL,” Kevin Stadmeyer, Technical Program Manager, wrote on the Google Online Security Blog. No links shared on Google Drive moving forward will be affected by this issue. However, existing shared links will need to be updated in order to avoid potential exposure.

"A crowdfunding effort to buy a subscription to the ShadowBrokers’ Monthly Dump Service of stolen exploits and data was shut down citing legal and ethical concerns. Heeding the advice of attorneys, law enforcement and peers in the security industry, a crowdfunding campaign that spun up to purchase the next batch of ShadowBrokers leaks has been squashed. The group announced this week more details on its impending Dump of the Month Service in which it promises to leak additional exploits and stolen data to subscribers. Those who join must pay in cryptocurrency (100 Zcash) approximately $24,450; this is as of today’s market value. The ShadowBrokers promoted the service last month, saying they still had in their possession browser and mobile handset exploits, attacks that work on Windows 10 systems and stolen nuclear and missile data belonging to Russian, China, Iran and North Korea. The crowdfunding effort, begun by Matthew Hickey of My Hacker House in the UK and a researcher who goes by the handle x0rz, hoped to raise $25,000, which would be used to buy the exploits and have them patched by the affected vendors. “If you ever want to hear a lawyer shout expletives at volume down a phone, you need to call him and tell him that you have created the first open source crowd-funded cyber arms acquisition attempt,” Hickey said in a statement via his Twitter account. “It transpires that should funds change hands from ours to the Shadow Brokers, we would be certainly risking some form of legal complications,” Hickey said. “It was just too risky and the advice was under no circumstances to proceed further with this.” X0rz’s statement, also via Twitter, had a similar tone and explained that their goal was to get the vulnerabilities involved patched and make “the 0days a little less toxic” than if released by the ShadowBrokers in the clear. “I personally expect the Shadow Brokers to release the dump because that’s their agenda,” x0rz wrote, adding that the $3,900 raised so far would be refunded to 40 contributors. “They are not here for the money and are really just seeking media coverage, as we previously witnessed.” Two days ago, Hickey hosted a Twitter poll asking whether a crowdfunding project to pay the subscription fee, perform an analysis on the dump and privately disclose would be a good idea. There were 1841 votes in 48 hours with 52 percent supporting the purchase; the poll also ignited a debate on the ethics of dealing with arms dealers or potentially a nation-state actor in the ShadowBrokers. “The discussion and debate we had over the last 48 hours publicly makes me very proud of the infosec community and the people within it. Our idea resulted in a civil and lengthy ethical debate with many different opinions. I was glad to take part in that,” Hickey told Threatpost. “What we saw in the last 48 hours was a transparent and open discussion on a cyber security topic that goes on daily in secret behind closed doors. Companies often pay for malware samples, bug bounties, exploit data and this discussion was no different—if anything it shone the light on a murky ethics topic around exploits. Having technology ethics advisors weigh in and the collective discussion that resulted played a part in our decision to pull the plug.” Hickey said there were a number of considerations around the crowdfunding effort, such as keeping it open and allowing the ShadowBrokers to claim it on the condition they privately disclosed, that the data could be validated prior to payment and that the group would work with researchers on getting vulnerabilities patched and/or mitigated. “There is just no way around the complication of paying them and putting our own freedoms at risk, we have to respect that opinions are equally divided on this topic,” Hickey said. Hickey also said he didn’t want to be caught in a tug of war between the U.S. and the ShadowBrokers if they are linked to the FSB and Russian intelligence. “All we can do is wait and see how ShadowBrokers respond, there is no evidence yet they have any more data but if they do I hope their release of it doesn’t result in another global cyber incident,” Hickey said. “Worse, I hope it doesn’t end up in the hands of other criminals who will use it for harm.” : Government Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1566 Phishing","<s>[INST] A crowdfunding effort to buy a subscription to the ShadowBrokers’ Monthly Dump Service of stolen exploits and data was shut down citing legal and ethical concerns.

Hickey also said he didn’t want to be caught in a tug of war between the U.S. and the ShadowBrokers if they are linked to the FSB and Russian intelligence. “All we can do is wait and see how ShadowBrokers respond, there is no evidence yet they have any more data but if they do I hope their release of it doesn’t result in another global cyber incident,” Hickey said. “Worse, I hope it doesn’t end up in the hands of other criminals who will use it for harm.” : Government Hacks Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1053 Scheduled Task/Job,T1018 Remote System Discovery,T1566 Phishing </s>"

There’s a remotely exploitable directory traversal vulnerability in more than 20 individual products from Schneider Electric that can enable an attacker to gain control of an affected machine. The flaw allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism on the server and get access to resources that should be protected. Security researcher Billy Rios, a frequent finder of vulnerabilities in ICS and SCADA software, discovered the vulnerabilities in SchneiderWEB, the human-machine interface implemented in many of the company’s products. An advisory from ICS-CERT warns that the vulnerability is trivially exploitable. “This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the basic authentication on the web server, which would allow unauthenticated administrative access and control over the device,” the advisory says. “Impact to individual organizations depends on many factors that are unique to each organization. NCCIC/ICS-CERT recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.” The vulnerability SchneiderWEB component is in 22 of the company’s products, and Schneider Electric said that the affected products are deployed in a variety of sectors, including communications, manufacturing, energy, water and others. The company has released an updated firmware version for vulnerable products that fixes the bug. “These vulnerabilities were discovered during cyber security research both by an external researcher and by Schneider Electric internal investigations.

"Google fixed a vulnerability that could’ve let an attacker carry out phishing attacks with Unicode domains in Chrome but Mozilla is holding off – for now. Google fixed a handful of issues when it released the latest version of its browser, Chrome 58, on Wednesday, including a vulnerability that could have made it easier for an attacker to carry out a phishing attack with Unicode domains. The vulnerability, based on Punycode – a way to represent Unicode with foreign characters – has been making headlines since it was disclosed last Friday. Discovered by Chinese researcher Xudong Zheng, the bug relies on tricking Chrome into bringing users to sites that appear legitimate. The sites could then convince victims to enter personal login or financial credentials. Zheng claims he disclosed the bug to Google on January 20 and that it was incorporated into beta builds on March 24, before finally getting fixed on Wednesday. The bug, considered medium severity, was one of 29 issues Google fixed on Wednesday. Three of the vulnerabilities were marked critical by Google, including a heap use after free in the browser’s Print Preview feature, and a pair of type confusion bugs – one in PDFium, Google’s open source PDF software library, and another in Blink, Chromium’s rendering engine. Google paid out $14,000 to researchers for their findings, a relatively modest sum after the company paid out nearly $55,000 in January for bugs in Chrome 56, and $38,000 in March for bugs in Chrome 57. The update came the same day that Mozilla pushed out a new version of its browser, Firefox 53 and Firefox ESR 52.1. Mozilla fixed six critical bugs with the update, including a pair of out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities, a pair of use-after-free vulnerabilities, a buffer overflow, and an origin confusion. If exploited, all of the bugs, except for the origin confusion flaw, could have resulted in a potentially exploitable crash. The origin confusion, which stemmed from reloading pages with redirects, could have only led to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Forty-one vulnerabilities were fixed with the update. Counting the nearly two dozen memory safety bugs fixed in the browser and ESR versions 45.9 and 52.1., 64 vulnerabilities were fixed with the update. Zheng claims the same URL spoofing vulnerability that existed in Chrome also exists in Firefox, but it appears Mozilla is holding off fixing it for now. Gervase Markham, a software engineer for the Mozilla Foundation, said earlier this week that Firefox users should turn on the browser’s Safe Browsing feature to help thwart phishing attacks like the one uncovered by Zheng. Markham, who’s also a lead developer of Bugzilla, said that if Mozilla were to start putting restrictions on scripts that happen to look like Latin, such as Cyrillic, it would be “making that script a second-class citizen because not as much can be represented using it.” Zheng’s research relies on using Unicode characters, which can represent Cyrillic and Greek alphabets, to mimic Latin letters and in turn trick user’s eyes. “There is no perfect solution to this problem,” Markham wrote on Bugzilla Tuesday, “Human languages are messy, inconsistent, and wonderful. Different scripts have letters which clash with each other. If you don’t want to be attacked this way, buy a domain in a TLD which doesn’t allow it. If your TLD does allow it, lobby your registry. In the mean time, Firefox users have Safe Browsing to protect them from actual phishing attempts, whether they use IDN lookalikes or not.” Mozilla published a FAQ dubbed “IDN Display Algorithm” in response to the bug which Markham says clearly illustrates the organization’s stance. “You may not agree with it, but it’s our considered position, so please do not comment further here unless you have new information to add which you genuinely believe has not been considered,” Markham wrote. Zheng is encouraging Firefox users to limit their exposure to the bug by going to the browser’s about:config settings and setting network.IDN_show_punycode to true. By doing this Firefox will always display IDN domains in its Punycode form, something that should make it easier to identify malicious domains, the researcher claims. : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] Google fixed a vulnerability that could’ve let an attacker carry out phishing attacks with Unicode domains in Chrome but Mozilla is holding off – for now.

"A handful of bugs, mostly XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities, have been plaguing at least eight different Wordpress plugins as of late. A smattering of bugs, mostly cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities, have been plaguing at least eight different WordPress plugins as of late. A security researcher going by the pseudonym Voxel@Night published on Monday information regarding the vulnerabilities, including proof of concepts for all of them on his personal blog Vextious Tendencies. The software company Ready! is responsible for developing three of the affected plugins that collectively have been downloaded almost 1.5 million times. Most troublesome among them is a version (v0.5.0) of its eCommerce platform. The researcher points out that the plugin fails to sanitize any of its output/AJAX calls, something that can open it up to CSRF attacks, and subsequently, a total compromise. Particularly of note is the fact that information end users supply when placing an order, such as their billing address, is later displayed unsanitized to administrators. Users meanwhile are met with an XSS notification. Two other plugins put out by Ready! contain similar issues. A Google Maps plugin it oversees could let anyone update a site’s maps to point to random places, while a Coming Soon plugin, designed to let site visitors know when websites that are being worked on are completed, fails to contain malicious inputs. Elsewhere, an issue with Easy Media Gallery, a plugin by GhozyLab that boasts that it’s the “#1 best selling gallery and portfolio plugin for WordPress” could lead to several CSRF vulnerabilities and let an attacker gain admin access to sites running it. According to the researcher, another photo gallery plugin, WP Photo Album Plus, contains a stored XSS vulnerability. Ironically what could be considered the least important vulnerability among the crop affects the most downloaded plugin, Contact Form, a relatively simple app that allows web developers to create a feedback page on their sites. Contact Form – – a plugin that boasts 2.3 million overall downloads – suffers from a bypass vulnerability that could let any user use AJAX functions. Voxel points out that the issue was initially brought up to the developer a year ago, in August 2013, but still, no changes have been made. Almost all of the vulnerabilities stem from sloppy coding and a lack of nonces – arbitrary numbers used in cryptographic settings designed to thwart attacks. When reached Tuesday, Alexey, the technical director and lead programmer for Ready! claimed the company had already submitted a fix for the eCommerce plugin, version 0.5.1, and was in the middle of addressing the vulnerabilities in the Coming Soon and Google Maps plugins. WordPress plugin vulnerabilities have seemingly become more and more ubiquitous over the last several months. Critical vulnerabilities in a popular WordPress mail plugin, MailPoet, could have opened sites using it up to a site takeover in July while in June, developers at TimThumb, a PHP-based image resizer, were forced to patch a zero day in its script that could have let attackers remove and modify files without authentication. While not directly related to its plugins, WordPress announced earlier this summer that like many other online entities as of late, it plans to enable SSL, along with Perfect Forward Secrecy, to help bolster users’ security before 2014 is through.

"The popular remote access tool PlugX enjoyed an ascent in popularity in 2014 and is now a go-to malware for attack groups. Existing in some form since 2008, the popular remote access tool PlugX has as notorious a history as any malware, but according to researchers the tool saw a spike of popularity in 2014 and is the go-to malware for many adversary groups. Many attacks, especially those occurring during the latter half of the year, were seen using the tool. In fact, researchers are theorizing the further proliferation of PlugX, which enables attackers to log keystrokes, modify and copy files, capture screenshots, as well as the ability to quit processes, log users off, and completely reboot users’ machines, could suggest eventual worldwide adoption. The malware was the most used variant when it came to targeted activity in 2014 according to Crowdstrike’s Global Threat Report, released today. Despite kicking around for years, the malware is now the de facto tool for dozens of China-based adversarial groups the firm tracks. One of the ways the malware improved itself in 2014, and in turn caught on, was by switching up the way it communicates with its infrastructure further up the chain. By implementing a newer DNS command and control module, the malware has been able to send its data in the form of long DNS queries to its overseeing infrastructure. Surge in PlugX infections could foreshadow future worldwide use via @Threatpost Tweet By modifying the way the DNS and HTTP requests are produced, something Crowdstrike is calling a deviation from “some of the more typically monitored protocols,” it’s made it more difficult to be detected over the past year or so. “The upward trend in use of PlugX indicates an increasing confidence in the capabilities of the platform, justifying its continued use across multiple sectors and countries,” according to the report. One of the groups that Crowdstrike caught dropping PlugX on machines was a hacking collective it calls Hurricane Panda, who used the malware’s custom DNS feature to spoof four DNS servers, including popular domains such as Pinterest.com, Adobe.com, and Github.com. Instead of their legitimate IP addresses, the malware was able to instead point these domains to a PlugX C+C node. The malware, as has been the case in the past, is commonly delivered via a spear phishing attack. Some of attacks go on to leverage a zero day from last March, CVE-2014-1761, which exploits vulnerable Microsoft RTF or Word documents. Others, meanwhile, make use of well-worn holes like CVE-2012-0158 in PowerPoint and Excel, that were also used by the IceFog, Red October, and Cloud Atlas attacks. While some of the groups using PlugX have gone out of their way to register new domains for leveraging the malware’s C+C, many domains from the last several years remain active, something else that Crowdstrike has attributed to the malware’s success and persistence over the years. The firm has two schools of thought when it comes to rationalizing how the malware has become so commonplace. It’s thought that there’s either a central malware dissemination channel that’s pushing PlugX out to adversary groups or that groups that hadn’t used PlugX in the past have recently been able to get copies of it via public repositories or the cybercrime underground. Either way, while the malware is mostly used by attackers from “countries surrounding China’s sphere of influence,” the report suggests that that trend could change soon enough. The malware has been used in recurring attacks against commercial entities in the U.S., and in other politically fueled attacks, but its rapid deployment “could be a precursor to future worldwide use,” according Crowdstrike. “The ongoing development of PlugX provides attackers with a flexible capability that requires continued vigilance on the part of network defenders in order to detect it reliably.” : Malware Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1021 Remote Services,T1566 Phishing,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] The popular remote access tool PlugX enjoyed an ascent in popularity in 2014 and is now a go-to malware for attack groups.

They’re usually also heavily physically secured in datacenters and server rooms with carefully monitored physical access. To put new data into an airgapped machine, typically a cybercriminal would have to physically breach the facility that it’s in and use some sort of external or removable media for their attack, such as an optical disc, a USB drive, or an external hard disk. Using airgapped machines is really inconvenient, so computers are usually only airgapped if they handle very, very sensitive data. That makes them especially attractive targets for attackers. If an airgapped machine was a purse, it would be a Hermès white Himalaya crocodile diamond Birkin bag whereas a typical client machine would be one of my beloved Tokidoki bags. (I much prefer my Tokidoki bags, by the way.) Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 discovered signs of a new attack for airgapped machines. Tick is a cyberespionage group that has targeted entities in South Korea and Japan. There’s a Korean defense contractor which makes USB drives according to very niche IT Security Certification Center guidelines for Korean public sector and private sector enterprise clientele. Unit 42 discovered that at least one of the USB drives have very carefully crafted malware on them. But Unit 42 researchers haven’t physically possessed any of the compromised USB drives. It should be difficult for an external party to get malware on one of those devices in the first place. Unit 42 calls the malware SymonLoader, and it exclusively exploits Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 vulnerabilities. So Tick has been trying to attack airgapped machines with versions of Windows which haven’t been supported for a long time. Do a lot of these airgapped machines run legacy operating systems? It’s highly probable that Tick carefully fingerprinted their targets before they started developing SymonLoader. Here’s the attack scenario that Unit 42 hypothesizes. Tick somehow acquired and compromised some of these heavily secured USB drives. They put their SymonLoader malware on them whenever they can acquire access to them. Once a compromised drive is mounted into a targeted airgapped Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 machine, SymonLoader exploits vulnerabilities which only pertain to those operating systems. While SymonLoader is in memory, if more heavily secured USB drives are detected as mounted to the file system, it’ll try to load the unknown malicious file using APIs designed for file system access. It’s the cycle of very specifically designed malware for very specific targets! It’s custom tailored haute couture Windows malware! It’s too exclusive for little people like me! (I use currently supported Linux Mint anyway.) Because Unit 42 doesn’t have any of the compromised drives in their possession, they can only speculate how the drives have been infected and how they’re delivered to their targets. Tick has been known to turn legitimate applications into Trojans. Here’s what Unit 42 wrote about HomamDownloader last summer: “HomamDownloader is a small downloader program with minimal interesting characteristics from a technical point of view. HomamDownloader was discovered to be delivered by Tick via a spearphishing email. The adversary crafted credible email and attachment after understanding the targets and their behavior… In addition to the social engineering email technique, the attacker also employs a trick to the attachment. The actor embedded malicious code to a resource section of the legitimate SFX file created by a file encryption tool, and modified the entry point of the program for jumping to the malicious code soon after the SFX program starts. The malicious code drops HomamDownloader, then jumps back to the regular flow in the CODE section, which in turn asks the user the password and decrypts the file. Therefore, once a user executes the attachment and sees the password dialog on SFX, the downloader dropped by the malicious code starts working even if the user chooses the Cancel on the password window.” Now it’s time to return to SymonLoader. Once a USB drive with SymonLoader is mounted into one of Tick’s targets, it tries to have the user execute it by using a Trojanized version of some sort of software that the user would want to install in their environment. Once executed, SymonLoader looks for other secured USB drives if and when they’re mounted into the file system. SymonLoader extracts a hidden executable file from a special secured USB drive and then executes it. Unit 42 researchers haven’t had a copy of the file to examine for themselves. But they’re pretty confident that Tick is behind this attack because they’ve found shellcode which resembles shellcode the group has previously been known to use. SymonLoader checks the machine for its version of Windows and if it’s newer than Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP, then it stops trying to do anything else. Windows Vista is its kryptonite, I guess. If the machine’s OS is Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, then a hidden window is executed which continuously checks for mounted drives as they become part of the file system. SymonLoader uses the SCSI INQUIRY command to verify if any of the newly mounted drives are of the specifically secured device model they’re looking for. If the parameters are ever matched, SymonLoader then extracts an unknown file from the USB drive. Not a lot else is known about how SymonLoader behaves or why, but Unit 42 wrote this: “While we do not have a copy of the file hidden on the secure USB, we have more than enough information to determine it is more than likely malicious. Weaponizing a secure USB drive is an uncommon technique and likely done in an effort to compromise airgapped systems, which are systems that do not connect to the public internet. Some industries or organizations are known for introducing air gapping for security reasons. In addition, outdated version operating systems are often used in those environments because of no easy-update solutions without internet connectivity. When users are not able to connect to external servers, they tend to rely on physical storage devices, particularly USB drives, for data exchange. The SymonLoader and secure USB drive discussed in this blog may fit for this circumstance.” That’s some MacGyver-level malware development and distribution.

"Apache has patched a critical remote code-execution vulnerability in Struts 2, and users should update immediately. A critical remote code-execution vulnerability in Apache Struts 2, the popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language, is threatening a wide range of applications, even when no additional plugins have been enabled. Successful exploitation could lead to full endpoint and eventually network compromise, according to researchers – who said that the flaw is more dangerous than the similar vulnerability used to compromise Equifax last year. A working exploit surfaced within a day of its disclosure. The vulnerability (CVE-2018-11776) was patched by the Apache Software Foundation yesterday and affects all supported versions of Struts 2: Users of Struts 2.3 should upgrade to 2.3.35; users of Struts 2.5 need to upgrade to 2.5.17. They should do so as soon as possible, given that bad actors are likely already working on exploits, according to the Semmle research team’s Man Yue Mo, who uncovered the flaw. “This vulnerability affects commonly-used endpoints of Struts, which are likely to be exposed, opening up an attack vector to malicious hackers,” he said in a posting on Wednesday. “On top of that, the weakness is related to the Struts Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) language, which hackers are very familiar with, and are known to have been exploited in the past.” OGNL is a powerful, domain-specific language that is used to customize Struts’ behavior. “On the whole, this is more critical than the highly critical Struts RCE vulnerability that the Semmle Security Research Team discovered and announced last September,” said Yue Mo, referring to the infamous vulns (CVE-2017-9805) that hackers used to compromise Equifax last year, which led to the lifting of personal details of 147 million consumers. Tim Mackey, technology evangelist at Synopsys, told Threatpost that this is due to the fact that it affects a wider swath of the Struts architecture. “In the case of CVE-2018-11776, the root cause [is] a lack of input validation on the URL passed to the Struts framework,” he explained. “The prior [Struts] vulnerabilities were all in code within a single functional area of the Struts code. This meant that developers familiar with that functional area could quickly identify and resolve issues without introducing new functional behaviors. CVE-2018-11776 operates at a far deeper level within the code, which in turns requires a deeper understanding of not only the Struts code itself, but the various libraries used by Struts. It is this level of understanding which is of greatest concern – and this concern relates to any library framework.” Anatomy of the Flaw The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core of the Struts framework, according to the team’s findings. “Attackers can attack vulnerable applications by injecting their own namespace as a parameter in an HTTP request,” they explained. “The value of that parameter is insufficiently validated by the Struts framework, and can be any OGNL string.” Because the issue affects the core of Struts, there are at least two separate attack vectors – and potentially many more. In the first attack scenario, three Struts result types are unsafe when used without a namespace, as defined in either in the Struts configuration file or in Java code if the Struts Convention plugin is used. These are the redirect action, which redirects the visitor to a different URL; action chaining, which is a method to chain multiple actions into a defined sequence or workflow; and postback result, which renders the current request parameters as a form which immediately submits a postback to the specified destination chain or postback. The researchers explained: “An example of a struts.xml configuration that is potentially vulnerable: the <action …> tag does not have a namespace attribute and contains a result of type redirectAction. If you use the Struts Convention plugin, you will also have to look for actions and results that are configured using Java code.” The second attack vector has to do with the fact that Struts supports page templates inside <result> tags in the Struts configuration: “The use of URL tags in such pages is potentially unsafe if the template is referred to from an <action> tag that does not provide a namespace attribute (or specifies a wildcard namespace),” the researchers said. “Your application is vulnerable if the template contains an <s:url …> tag without an action or value attribute.” Researchers noted that for an exploit for either of the known vectors to be successful, an application must have the alwaysSelectFullNamespace flag set to “true” in the Struts configuration – a default state if the application uses the popular Struts Convention plugin. Also, the application’s actions must be configured without specifying a namespace, or with a wildcard namespace (e.g. “/*”). “This applies to actions and namespaces specified in the Struts configuration file (e.g. <action namespace=”main”>), but also to actions and namespaces specified in Java code if you are using the Struts Convention plugin,” they explained. That said, they also cautioned that other attack vectors may emerge that apply to different configurations. “Whether or not a Struts application is vulnerable to remote code execution largely depends on the exact configuration and architecture of the application,” the firm said. “Note that even if an application is currently not vulnerable, an inadvertent change to a Struts configuration file may render the application vulnerable in the future. You are therefore strongly advised to upgrade your Struts components, even if you believe your configuration not to be vulnerable right now.” This is a critical point, according to Mackey. “Validating the input to a function requires a clear definition of what is acceptable,” he said. “It equally requires that any functions available for public use document how they use the data passed to them. Absent the contract such definitions and documentation form, it’s difficult to determine if the code is operating correctly or not. This contract becomes critical when patches to libraries are issued as its unrealistic to assume that all patches are free from behavioral changes. Modern software is increasingly complex and identifying how data passes through it should be a priority for all software development teams.” Pavel Avgustinov, vice president of QL Engineering at Semmle, laid out what’s at stake in a media statement: “Critical remote code-execution vulnerabilities like the one that affected Equifax and the one we announced [this week] are incredibly dangerous for several reasons: Struts is used for publicly-accessible customer-facing websites, vulnerable systems are easily identified, and the flaw is easy to exploit,” he said. “A hacker can find their way in within minutes, and exfiltrate data or stage further attacks from the compromised system. It’s crucially important to update affected systems immediately; to wait is to take an irresponsible risk.” : Editor's Picks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] Apache has patched a critical remote code-execution vulnerability in Struts 2, and users should update immediately.

"The Russian spy group, a.k.a. BlackEnergy, is actively compromising Exim mail servers via a critical security vulnerability. The Russia-linked APT group Sandworm has been spotted exploiting a vulnerability in the internet’s top email server software, according to the National Security Agency (NSA). The bug exists in the Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software, an open-source offering used on Linux and Unix-like systems. It essentially receives, routes and delivers email messages from local users and remote hosts. Exim is the default MTA included on some Linux distros like Debian and Red Hat, and Exim-based mail servers in general run almost 57 percent of the internet’s email servers, according to a survey last year. The bug (CVE-2019-10149) would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on an Exim mail server, allowing the attacker to install programs, modify data and create new accounts. It’s also wormable; a previous campaign spread cryptominers automatically from system to system using a port sniffer. The bug was patched last June. The NSA this week released a cybersecurity advisory on new exploit activity from Unit 74455 of the GRU Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST), a division of the Russian military intelligence service, a.k.a. Sandworm, a.k.a. BlackEnergy. The APT has been linked to the Industroyer attack on the Ukrainian power grid as well as the infamous NotPetya attacks. According to Kaspersky, the group is part of a nexus of related APTs that also includes a recently discovered group called Zebrocy. The flaw can be exploited using a specially crafted email containing a modified “MAIL FROM” field in a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) message. The APT has been exploiting unpatched Exim servers in this way since at least August, according the NSA’s advisory. Once Sandworm compromises a target Exim server, it subsequently downloads and executes a shell script from a Sandworm-controlled domain to establish a persistent backdoor that can be used for reconnaissance, spying on mail messages, lateral movement and additional malware implantation. “This script would attempt to do the following on the victim machine: Add privileged users; disable network security settings; update SSH configurations to enable additional remote access; and execute an additional script to enable follow-on exploitation,” according to the NSA, which didn’t disclose any details as to the victimology of the latest offensives. Exim admins should update their MTAs to version 4.93 or newer to mitigate the issue, the NSA noted. “This emphasizes the need for a good vulnerability management plan,” Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research at Tripwire, said via email. “CVE-2019-10149 has been out almost a year now and has a CVSS score above 9, making it a critical vulnerability.

"Security experts express concern over the world’s No. 1 router manufacturer losing control over domains used for device configuration Top router firm TP-Link has lost control of two key domains accessed by millions of consumers and small businesses each month. The domains, which are used to configure the company’s routers, have expired and been resold to domain name brokers who are actively seeking buyers. Security experts say the domains are at risk of being purchased by criminals that could easily use the domains to take control of millions of routers by redirecting traffic, installing malicious firmware and ultimately attack millions of TP-Link router customers. China-based TP-Link is the world’s leading Wi-Fi gateway router equipment maker, according to market research firm IDC. The company sold 57.8 million routers in 2015 and regularly outsells rivals Netgear and D-Link, according to IDC data. The two domains in question are tplinklogin[.]net and tplinkextender[.]net. The tplinklogin[.]net domain was used by TP-Link to make it easy for router owners to access configuration webpages for many of the company’s routers. The domain, tplinklogin[.]net, was displayed on back labels of router hardware and also included on official documentation of the router. TP-Link declined a request to be interview by Threatpost, but said it stopped using the domain tplinklogin[.]net in 2014. “Any products purchased at that time using the old domain (tplinklogin[.]net ) will be automatically redirected to the internal set-up page, so there will not be any security issues,” the company wrote in a statement to Threatpost.

The domains, which are used to configure the company’s routers, have expired and been resold to domain name brokers who are actively seeking buyers. Security experts say the domains are at risk of being purchased by criminals that could easily use the domains to take control of millions of routers by redirecting traffic, installing malicious firmware and ultimately attack millions of TP-Link router customers. China-based TP-Link is the world’s leading Wi-Fi gateway router equipment maker, according to market research firm IDC. The company sold 57.8 million routers in 2015 and regularly outsells rivals Netgear and D-Link, according to IDC data. The two domains in question are tplinklogin[.]net and tplinkextender[.]net.

"Rapid7 has reported and disclosed a half-dozen XSS and SQL injection flaws in popular network management systems, all of which can be reached via SNMP. Update Four leading network management system providers are busying patching and preparing fixes for a half-dozen critical cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities disclosed Wednesday by Rapid7. Two Three of the affected vendors, Spiceworks, Ipswitch and Opsview, have already patched their respective products, while Castle Rock Computing has yet to set a timeline for the availability of patches. These management planes provide enterprises with a view into network activity and performance, and hackers with an attractive attack vector. Access to a management plane such as these, for example, would be invaluable in mapping a network, looking for pivot points to other systems and identifying existing vulnerabilities in anything managed by the system. “The fact that many of these protocols are delivered over SNMP is also very interesting; too often, designers of management software, which is intended for internal, use don’t consider the insider threat,” said Tod Beardsley, principal security research manager at Rapid7. Rapid7’s Deral Heiland and indepdenent security researcher Matthew Kienow are credited with finding the vulnerabilities. SNMP is the simple network management protocol and is the protocol over which most network management systems communicate configuration changes and other commands to devices such as routers, servers, workstations and more. Opsview was the first to patch, releasing a fix on Nov. 6 for stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities on the Opsview web application server and client respectively affecting version 4.6.3. Exploits via SNMP traps and the SNMP agent could lead to code injection and execution in the victim’s browser; an authenticated browser session could lead to further attacks, Rapid7 said. Spiceworks also patched a stored server XSS bug in the web application component of Spiceworks Desktop via SNMP, affecting versions 7.3.00065, 7.3.00076 and 7.4.00075. Attackers may exploit his vulnerability without authentication; this vulnerability was patched Dec. 1. Ipswitch, meanwhile, on Wednesday patched persistent XSS and SQL injection flaws in its WhatsUpGold network management system. Attackers would require authentication to exploit the SQL injection bug, while the cross-site scripting vulnerability can be attacked without it. Versions 16.2.6 and 16.3.1 are affected, Rapid7 said. In exploiting the persistent XSS bug, an attacker would be able to inject JavaScript into a number of fields, which when viewed by WhatsUpGold, will executed under the privileges of the user and allow an attacker to modify settings, steal data or attack the host if configured with SNMP. The SQL injection bug, if the attacker is authenticated, could allow an attacker to steal from a database using tools such as SQLMAP. Castle Rock Computing’s SNMPc Enterprise 9 and a web-based reporting and monitoring tool called SNMPc OnLine 12.1 is vulnerable to a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited without authentication. Again, as with the Ipswitch XSS bug, an attacker could inject JavaScript into fields and once the NMS product views those fields, the code executes.

"Microsoft, in 2009, silently fixed a FASTFAT driver flaw in Windows 7, leaving the same vulnerability in older Windows versions until it was patched this week. UPDATE – Microsoft this week patched a vulnerability in the FASTFAT driver that interacts with FAT32 disk partitions, closing a privilege escalation and code execution hole in Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. But what about Windows 7 and up versions of the OS, you may be asking? Granted, newer Windows releases lean toward NTFS as the file system format, but FAT32 is still an available option in all supported versions. Would newer versions be vulnerable too? As it turns out, according to researchers at BeyondTrust, Microsoft had already silently patched what turned out to be MS14-063 in Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, and apparently left older versions exposed for at least five years. That means well-resourced attackers have had quite a window of opportunity available to them to exploit what turns out to be a noteworthy memory corruption issue. The vulnerability picks up additional significance in that it can be most easily exploited via USB drives, which are often formatted for FAT32. Should an attacker manage to load a malicious FAT file onto a USB stick and get someone to use the removable drive, they’d be able to exploit the bug. “In the FAT format, you can rewrite parts of it that lead to memory corruption so that when you stick a USB in a computer regardless of whether it’s locked, you can corrupt memory and execute code,” said BeyondTrust chief technology officer Marc Maiffret. “It’s a nasty bug. There’s a bit of nuance here in that it’s not a USB vulnerability, but if you were going to deliver a corrupted FAT file, you would do it through USB.” Microsoft refused a request to comment on this story. Microsoft patched the vulnerability, CVE-2014-4115, this week after it was reported privately by Cisco researcher Marcin Noga. Maiffret goes through the process BeyondTrust researchers went through in comparing an unpatched version of fastfat.sys on Windows Server 2003r2 to the patched one released this week in order to locate the problem code. The lingering question, however, was why was Windows 7 immune? Doing a quick comparison there, he found what was likely the same fix, however, this one was signed in 2009. “The worry is that Cisco found the vulnerability and responsibly reported it to Microsoft and it was fixed. From the research side, there’s no comparison [in resources] to some governments and defense contractors looking at these vulnerabilities. There’s always the worry that it’s been there for many years and should have been taken care of.” This isn’t the first time Maiffret has done research in this area. In 2006 at Black Hat Europe while at eEye, Maiffret and colleagues Steve Manzuik and Andre Protas presented about similar silent fixes in Microsoft products. Maiffret urges enterprises running Windows to push resources toward running the latest major release from Microsoft, whether it’s Windows, Office or Internet Explorer. To back that up, Maiffret shared research that showed that for much of 2013 and part of 2014, 30 percent of vulnerabilities in Windows 7, IE10 and/or Office 2010 were exploited, compared to five percent of vulnerabilities in Windows 8, IE11 and Office 2013. “It is so important for security people to understand when protecting a Windows environment that one of the single best things you can do to measurably improve your security is simply making sure you are running the latest major released versions of Microsoft software,” Maiffret said. “Windows 8 vs. 7 and XP; Office 2013 vs. 2010; IE 11 vs. 10/9/8 etc… These upgrades are not simply IT line item budgets but equally security ones.” This article was updated at 6:15 p.m. ET to reflect that Microsoft refused to comment. : Vulnerabilities","T1055 Process Injection,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] Microsoft, in 2009, silently fixed a FASTFAT driver flaw in Windows 7, leaving the same vulnerability in older Windows versions until it was patched this week.

"A phishing kit has been found running on at least 700 domains – and mimicking services via false SharePoint, OneDrive and Office 365 login portals. A newly-uncovered phishing kit, dubbed LogoKit, eliminates headaches for cybercriminals by automatically pulling victims’ company logos onto the phishing login page. This gives attackers the tools needed to easily mimic company login pages, a task that can sometimes be complex. Cybercriminals have relied on LogoKit to launch phishing attacks on more than 700 unique domains over the past 30 days (including 300 in the past week). These targeted services range from generic login portals to false SharePoint, Adobe Document Cloud, OneDrive, Office 365, and cryptocurrency exchange login portals. “With LogoKit’s intended functionality to be centered around singular emails per URL and extracting company logos, this dramatically improves ease of carrying out targeted attacks against organizations; and reusing pretexts without changing templates,” said Adam Castleman, security researcher with RiskIQ on Wednesday. Phishing Kits Phishing kits, which can be purchased by cybercriminals for anything between $20 and $880, require little technical knowledge to operate beyond modest programming skills. These kits are utilized to steal various data from victims – including usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, social security numbers and more. In order to operate a kit, a cybercriminal must first install it on a remote server – either by compromising a legitimate content management system, or by utilizing their own infrastructure. Once installed, an attacker merely spams victims  – via email messages, SMS or social media messages – with the URL that will take them to the phishing kit’s landing page. Some phishing kits contain administrator dashboards where cybercriminals can track the number of visits to their malicious website and view the sensitive data disclosed. Phishing kits are nothing new – however, LogoKit makes the deployment of phishing login pages even easier for cybercriminals. Many times, cybercriminals that use phishing kits on top of compromised, legitimate content management systems deal with complex website layouts and multiple files. This could lead to glitches in the login page that serve as potential red flags for victims. LogoKit skips over this problem with its simplicity, said researchers, as it executes only a few lines of customizable JavaScript. This allows bad actors to easily integrate the kit into either existing HTML pretext templates or build simple login forms to mimic corporate login portals. The kit also stands out in that it has the ability to load resources from trusted sources, including legitimate object storage buckets. This is another trick that’s not necessarily brand new – but that makes fake login pages appear less malicious by having users navigate to a known domain name. In some cases, for instance, attackers have been observed hosting their phishing pages on Google Firebase as part of the LogoKit attack. Google Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that is backed by Google Cloud Storage and provides secure file uploads and downloads for Firebase apps. How It Works While LogoKit has been found using these legitimate hosting services, researchers have also observed compromised web sites – many running WordPress — to be hosting LogoKit variants. In both cases, cybercriminals send victims a specially crafted URL containing their email address. An example of a crafted URL that contains the email would be: “phishingpage[.]site/login.html#victim@company.com.” “The location hash is then broken down into slices,” according to researchers. “The slice’s delimiter is the ‘@’ symbol, allowing the script to extract the user’s/company’s domain to fetch the logo and eventually redirect a victim.” If victim clicks on the URL, LogoKit then fetches the company logo from a third-party service, such as marketing data engine Clearbit or Google’s database for favicons (the graphic icons associated with particular webpages). A phishing page running LogoKit. Credit: RiskIQ The victim’s email is also auto-filled into the email or username input field of the login graphic. Researchers noted, this trick makes victims believe they have previously logged into the site. Should a victim enter their password, LogoKit performs an AJAX request, sending the target’s email and password to an external source. In some cases, as an added trick, after performing validation to ensure data is entered and a valid email address is present, the kit will “fake a user out” by telling them that their password is incorrect and prompting them to enter the password again. Then, as a final step, the victim is redirected to their corporate website after entering their password. Several sectors have been targeted by attackers using LogoKit, including financial, legal, and entertainment, said researchers. “The LogoKit presents a unique opportunity for attackers, allowing for easy integration into either existing HTML pretext templates or building simple login forms to mimic corporate login portals,” said Castleman. “Also, with the flexibility of either leveraging compromised infrastructure, attacker-hosted infrastructure, or object storage, attackers can quickly change their delivery source.”","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] A phishing kit has been found running on at least 700 domains – and mimicking services via false SharePoint, OneDrive and Office 365 login portals.

A phishing page running LogoKit. Credit: RiskIQ The victim’s email is also auto-filled into the email or username input field of the login graphic. Researchers noted, this trick makes victims believe they have previously logged into the site. Should a victim enter their password, LogoKit performs an AJAX request, sending the target’s email and password to an external source. In some cases, as an added trick, after performing validation to ensure data is entered and a valid email address is present, the kit will “fake a user out” by telling them that their password is incorrect and prompting them to enter the password again. Then, as a final step, the victim is redirected to their corporate website after entering their password. Several sectors have been targeted by attackers using LogoKit, including financial, legal, and entertainment, said researchers. “The LogoKit presents a unique opportunity for attackers, allowing for easy integration into either existing HTML pretext templates or building simple login forms to mimic corporate login portals,” said Castleman. “Also, with the flexibility of either leveraging compromised infrastructure, attacker-hosted infrastructure, or object storage, attackers can quickly change their delivery source.” [/INST] T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information </s>"

"Reading Time: 5 minutes Would you be scared or at least anxious if you’d found a subpoena to the US district court in your email box? Most of the people definitely would. That’s exactly what the malicious attackers counted for when conducted this massive attack from Russia-based IPs with sophisticated and cunning ransomware payload. Social engineering: faked authority cause real fear 3582 users became the targets of this malicious email disguised as “United States District Court” subpoena.  As you can see, the email consists of the whole bunch of social engineering tricks to convince the users to open the malicious attachment. Mainly, the perpetrators try to play on the emotional strings of fear, authority and curiosity to manipulate the victims. Installing this emotional-aroused state into the receivers’ minds is aimed to suppress their ability for critical thinking and make them act rashly. Also, the email address of the sender is “uscourtgove.com”, which, of course, is faked but adds more credibility to the email. Having the password for the attachment strengthens the flavor of the mail solidity. The subject of email is “megaloman” and document attached is named “scan.megaloman.doc” and this match also adds some small touches of credibility. And threatening the victim with responsibility if she “fails to do for is bounden to you” (and the only way to find out that is to open the file in attachment) is the icing on the cake. This blow-up manipulative cocktail is a potent tool to help the perpetrators to get what they want. So the risk for many people to fall prey to this scam is very high. Now let’s see what happens if a user opens the file in the attachment. The malware: first hides, then hits Of course, it has nothing in common to subpoena. In reality, as Comodo Threat Research Labs analysts discovered, it’s a new variant of cunning and sophisticated Sigma ransomware that will encrypt files on the infected machine and extorts the ransom to decrypt them. How Sigma ransomware functions:  What is special in this new variant of Sigma is that it requests the user to enter the password. Um… password for malware? Throughout it can sound weird, in reality it has the clear purpose: more obfuscation of the malware from detection. But even if the user will enter the password, the file won’t run immediately. If the macros are turned off on the victim’s machine, it convincingly asks to turn them off. Notice, how this require fits into the whole attackers’ strategy: if it’s a message from the court it definitely can be a protected document, right? But in reality the file includes a malicious VBScript that must be run to begin installing the malware on the victim’s computer. It downloads the next part of the malware from the attackers’ server, saves it to %TEMP% folder, disguises it as svchost.exe process and executes it. This svchost.exe acts as a dropper to download one more part of the malware. Then via a rather long chain of actions – again, for stronger obfuscation – it completes the malicious payload and runs it. The malware looks really impressive with its variety of tricks to hide and avoid detection. Before running, it checks the environment for virtual machine or sandboxes. If it discovers one, the malware kills itself. It disguises its malicious process and registry entries as legitimate ones like “svchost.exe” and “chrome”. And that’s not all. Unlike some of its close ransomware relatives, Sigma does not act immediately but lurks and makes covert reconnaissance first. It creates a list of valuable files, counts them and sends this value to its C&C server along with other information about the victim’s machine. If no files were found, Sigma just deletes itself. It also doesn’t infect a computer, if finds out that its country location is Russian Federation or Ukraine. The malware connection to its Command-and-Control server is also complicated. As the server is TOR-based, Sigma takes a sequence of steps: 1. Downloads the TOR software using this link: https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/7.0/tor-win32-0.3.0.7.zip 2. Saves it to %APPDATA% as System.zip 3. Unzips it to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\YOUR_SYSTEM_ID 4. Deletes System.zip 5. Renames Tor\\tor.exe as svchost.exe 6. Executes it 7. Waits for a while and sends its request And only after that Sigma begins to encrypt files on the victim’s machine. Then ransom note will capture the poisoned machine’s screen. And … finita la commedia. If the victim didn’t previously arrange to make backups, her data is lost. There is no way to restore them. Protection: how to fight back “Facing with malware so sophisticated on both sides, social engineering tricks and technical design, is a hard challenge for even security-aware users,” says Fatih Orhan, the Head of Comodo Threat Research Labs. “To protect against such cunning attacks you need to have something more reliable than just people awareness. In this case, a real solution must give 100% guarantee that your assets won’t be harmed even if someone takes the crooks’ bait and run the malware. That’s exactly what exclusive Comodo auto-containment technology gives our customers: any arriving unknown file is automatically put into the secure environment, where it can be run with no single possibility to harm a host, system or network.

"The critical vulnerability, which was patched earlier in September, has put ColdFusion servers at risk. An Adobe ColdFusion vulnerability, patched two months ago, was being exploited in the wild by a China-linked APT group, researchers found. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-15961, is a critical unrestricted file upload bug that could also lead to arbitrary code-execution, researchers at Volexity, who discovered the exploitation, said on Thursday. “Volexity recently observed active exploitation of a newly patched vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion, for which no public details or proof-of-concept code exists,” researchers said in a post. “In the attack detected by Volexity, a suspected Chinese APT group was able to compromise a vulnerable ColdFusion server by directly uploading a China Chopper webshell. The target server was missing a single update from Adobe that had been released just two weeks earlier.” Adobe issued a fix for the unauthenticated file upload vulnerability in September. The company did not respond to a request for further comment from Threatpost. The flaws impact Adobe’s ColdFusion product, which is the company’s commercial web application development platform. Specifically impacted are ColdFusion 11 (Update 14 and earlier), ColdFusion 2016 (Update 6 and earlier), and ColdFusion 2018 (July 12 release). This effectively includes all versions of ColdFusion released over the last four years. The flaw stems from a WYSIWYG rich text editor in modern versions of ColdFusion, CKEditor. While Adobe replaced the older WYSIWYG editor, FCKeditor, in previous versions of ColdFusion with CKEditor, “it appears … they inadvertently introduced an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability,” said researchers. The Exploit Researchers at Volexity first observed the exploited vulnerability two weeks after Adobe released its update. “The attackers we observed uploaded a China Chopper webshell to the compromised server which allowed them to easily execute commands as if they had direct command line access,” Matthew Meltzer, security researcher at Volexity told Threatpost. “In the instance we observed the attackers performed reconnaissance commands, examining the system and network.” The vulnerability can be easily exploited through a simple HTTP POST request to the file upload.cfm, which is not restricted and does not require any authentication, they said. The APT group, which researchers did not give a specific name for, was observed exploiting the flaw to upload the JSP version of China Chopper, a web shell widely used by Chinese hackers and APT groups to remotely access compromised Web servers. From there, the group’s China Chopper executed commands on the impacted web server before being cut off. “We were able to quickly detect and cut off this group from the compromised network, however if access had remained uninterrupted, we suspect they would have attempted to escalate privileges, obtain credentials that could be used across the network, and move laterally.  This is typically what we have observed in past compromises by other advanced threat groups,” said Meltzer. After this initial discovery, researchers found that numerous other ColdFusion webservers also appear to have been compromised – belonging to a variety of organizations, such as educational institutions, state government, health research, humanitarian aid organizations, and more. “Each of the sites showed signs of attempted webshell uploads or had HTML files designed to show they had been defaced,” the researchers said. “Volexity was not able to confirm that CVE-2018-15961 was the vulnerability abused in these instances. However, based on the placement of the files on the affected servers, Volexity believes that a non-APT actor may have  identified this vulnerability prior to September 11, 2018.” Researchers urged Adobe ColdFusion users to update- and in the meantime, to examine their log files and directories for anything that looks suspicious. “Volexity recommends organizations identify any instances of Adobe ColdFusion currently in use, and verify the current version running,” they said. “It is highly recommended that any vulnerable instances be patched to the latest version immediately.” : Editor's Picks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] The critical vulnerability, which was patched earlier in September, has put ColdFusion servers at risk.

"A bug exploitable in WordPress 4.8.2 and earlier creates unexpected and unsafe conditions ripe for a SQL-injection attack. A bug exploitable in WordPress 4.8.2 and earlier creates unexpected and unsafe conditions ripe for a SQL injection attack, exposing sites created on the content management system to takeover. WordPress released WordPress 4.8.3 Tuesday, which mitigates the vulnerability. “This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately,” according to WordPress. The vulnerability is not tied to the WordPress Core, rather plugins and themes that could be used to trigger a SQL injection attack, WordPress said. The 4.8.3 update fixes a previous release made available on Sept. 19. “Worst case would be remote code execution where they could take over installs of WordPress and the servers they are running on,” said Anthony Ferrara, the researcher who identified the flawed WordPress 4.8.2 patch. The roots of the SQL injection date back to a vulnerability (CVE-2017-14723) first reported on Sept. 17, 2017. WordPress then attempted to mitigate the vulnerability with WordPress 4.8.2. That patch did not fix the issue, worsened the underlying security vulnerability and “broke” a large undisclosed number of third-party WordPress plugins. “Our plugin broke,” said Matt Barry, a lead developer at WordFence. “The initial WordPress fix created huge headaches for plugin developers like us.” On Sept. 20, Ferrara reported through the HackerOne bug bounty platform the fix was incomplete. “I filed a security vulnerability report and notify them the fix isn’t a fix and suggest they should revert and fix properly (with included details on how to fix),” according to a post outlining the disclosure on Ferrara’s personal blog. After going back and forth with WordPress for weeks, Ferrara said on Oct. 16 he announced his intent for public disclosure. More back and forth ensued, and on Oct. 20 he said WordPress told Ferrara it was “working on it” and discussing details of the fix. After 11 more days of hammering out the technical details of that fix, on Oct. 31 the 4.8.2 patch was released. The vulnerability itself affects WordPress versions 4.8.2 and earlier. The issue occurred because where “$wpdb->prepare() can create unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection,” describes WordPress. The root issue is that the prepare system is poorly designed and needed to be fixed, Ferraray said.

A bug exploitable in WordPress 4.8.2 and earlier creates unexpected and unsafe conditions ripe for a SQL injection attack, exposing sites created on the content management system to takeover. WordPress released WordPress 4.8.3 Tuesday, which mitigates the vulnerability. “This is a security release for all previous versions and we strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately,” according to WordPress. The vulnerability is not tied to the WordPress Core, rather plugins and themes that could be used to trigger a SQL injection attack, WordPress said. The 4.8.3 update fixes a previous release made available on Sept. 19. “Worst case would be remote code execution where they could take over installs of WordPress and the servers they are running on,” said Anthony Ferrara, the researcher who identified the flawed WordPress 4.8.2 patch. The roots of the SQL injection date back to a vulnerability (CVE-2017-14723) first reported on Sept. 17, 2017. WordPress then attempted to mitigate the vulnerability with WordPress 4.8.2. That patch did not fix the issue, worsened the underlying security vulnerability and “broke” a large undisclosed number of third-party WordPress plugins. “Our plugin broke,” said Matt Barry, a lead developer at WordFence. “The initial WordPress fix created huge headaches for plugin developers like us.” On Sept. 20, Ferrara reported through the HackerOne bug bounty platform the fix was incomplete. “I filed a security vulnerability report and notify them the fix isn’t a fix and suggest they should revert and fix properly (with included details on how to fix),” according to a post outlining the disclosure on Ferrara’s personal blog. After going back and forth with WordPress for weeks, Ferrara said on Oct. 16 he announced his intent for public disclosure. More back and forth ensued, and on Oct. 20 he said WordPress told Ferrara it was “working on it” and discussing details of the fix. After 11 more days of hammering out the technical details of that fix, on Oct. 31 the 4.8.2 patch was released. The vulnerability itself affects WordPress versions 4.8.2 and earlier. The issue occurred because where “$wpdb->prepare() can create unexpected and unsafe queries leading to potential SQL injection,” describes WordPress. The root issue is that the prepare system is poorly designed and needed to be fixed, Ferraray said. He said a patch to remove the “double prepare” from meta.php was eventually delivered, mitigating the vulnerability. “These types of fixes can be tricky,” Barry said. Plugins are often the friendly-fire casualties for these types of WordPress patches, he said. “The core issue is mitigated.

"Comodo has identified a new PayPal phishing email, which is being sent via a server in Turkey. Because PayPal uses email to contact its customers, fraudsters can easily fake the name in the sender’s email address. The email contains only a clickable image of a textual letter, with no text outside the image. The text in the image begins, “we need your help resolving an issue with your account.” The email redirects the user to a site in the Belarusian language, closely imitating the PayPal login page. The likely intention here is to forge PayPal accounts in a nefarious effort to collect credit card information. While the user sees the message as having been sent from “PayPal Customer Service,” the email is actually sent from xfikir@xfikir.com RFC Sender: aaaa@server.xfikir.com. PayPal’s “Common email scams” webpage explains how sophisticated fraudsters can fake the entire reply name to look like a legitimate sender, so be careful. The message redirects the user to “www.serviceprint.by,” which initiates the following process: 1. The user is redirected to a PayPal imitation login page 2. Any and all user credentials–including erroneous account information–will lead to an extended loading process 3. Users are then requested to update their billing address 4. Users are informed to enter their credit card information 5. Now the user is redirected to the legitimate PayPal site PayPal urges its users to report suspect emails to spoof@paypal.com According to PayPal’s website, emails from PayPal will: Come from www.paypal.com. Scammers can easily fake the “friendly name,” but it’s more difficult to fake the full name. A sender such as “PayPal Service (zxk1942R3@gmail.com)” is not a message from PayPal.

"Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in PHPMailer and SwiftMailer, libraries used to send emails via PHP, were patched this week. Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities in two different libraries used to send emails via PHP were patched this week. An issue in PHPMailer, thought fixed, was resolved with an update, version 5.2.21, pushed late Wednesday. Developers with another mailing library for PHP, SwiftMailer, remedied a similar issue that could have also led to remote code execution on Thursday. Both bugs were disclosed this week by researcher Dawid Golunski of Legal Hackers. An attacker could have exploited the PHPMailer vulnerability (CVE-2016-10033) by targeting website components that use PHPMailer, like contact/registration forms, password email reset forms, and so forth. In addition to giving a remote attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code, the vulnerability also could have given attackers access to a web server hosting a web app that used a vulnerable version of the library. To get the word out, a website for the vulnerability, nicknamed PwnScriptum, and a logo, began making the rounds earlier this week. It was learned early Wednesday an update PHPMailer pushed to fix the original issue over the weekend, version 5.2.18, could be bypassed. That bypass was given a new CVE (CVE-2016-10045) something that put the original issue back at ‘square one,’ according to the researcher. “There is no public patch at the moment. All PHPMailer versions are vulnerable again. Back to square one,” Golunski told Threatpost Wednesday. PHPMailer eventually fixed the bypass issue with an update, version 5.2.20, later that day. The SwiftMailer vulnerability (CVE-2016-10074) could have been exploited through the same means as the PHPMailer vulnerability: contact/registration forms, password email reset forms, and any other components that use the SwiftMailer class. Before a fix was applied, the vulnerability affected all versions of the library, including the then-current release, 5.4.5-DEV. Citing weeks of inactivity by the vendor, Golunski disclosed the vulnerability on Wednesday. Once disclosed, SwiftMailer acted fast to fix the vulnerability, pushing version 5.4.5 on Thursday. According to the changelog for SwiftMailer on GitHub, developers fixed the issue by deprecating the mail transport used by the library, Swift_Transport_MailTransport, as it was vulnerable to passing arbitrary shell arguments. Golunski published a similar proof of concept exploit for another PHP framework, Zend Framework, on December 30. Zend, the company responsible for the framework, patched the vulnerability in zend-mail, starting in version 2.7.2, zend-mail, 2.4.11, and Zend Framework, 2.4.11, on December 20. Golunski claims he will publish a more robust disclosure, in which he will discuss other vectors and exploits, in a future whitepaper. Golunski has had a busy end to 2016. In addition to the PHPMailer and SwiftMailer vulnerabilities, he uncovered two critical vulnerabilities in the open source IT infrastructure monitoring software Nagios Core earlier this month. If exploited those vulnerabilities could have been used to elevate privileges to root and gain remote code execution.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes “The October 2017 discovery of KRACK is significant for the security of virtually all smart phone users; the threat is real and pervasive” said Fatih Orhan, head of the Comodo Threat Intelligence Lab and Comodo Threat Research Labs (CTRL). This blog explores the questions (and provides some answers) about the key new vulnerabilities and potential attacks associated with “KRACK.” What is KRACK? KRACK is the name for the Key Reinstallation Attacks and related vulnerabilities to the WPA2 protocol for wireless. WPA2 is used by nearly all IT devices today, including mobile devices everywhere. What happened? The WPA2 protocol is vulnerable. This week, vulnerabilities in the Wi-Fi industry’s encryption standard were revealed. An attacker in the proximity of a Wi-Fi network and the target computer may exploit vulnerabilities with a Key Installation Attack allowing them to read information that was previously assumed to be encrypted. By using this attack, data being sent from a WPA2-encrypted Wi-Fi device could be recorded including passwords, credit card details and enterprise logins. Who is at risk? All Wi-Fi enabled devices are at risk as this vector is in the Wi-Fi standard itself. Why is this so important? We may never be able to entirely trust WPA2 again. As soon as patches are available, your local administrators will update device firmware for routers, access points and hotspots, but while that will return trust to the enterprise Wi-Fi networks, public hotspots at airports and coffee shops may remain unprotected for some time. Older devices may never receive an update, leaving WPA2 on public hotspots forever untrustworthy. The web’s SSL protocol offers an additional protection that can only protect transactions performed under that protocol. Mobile devices come with the highest risk profile. They are commonly configured to automatically join Wi-Fi hotspots, and users will connect where possible to reduce data costs. Statistics provided by Wi-Fi Alliance show that 71% of all mobile communications flow over Wi-Fi and that number has been growing rapidly. Both the device and the access point must be updated to protect against KRACK, so in effect, 100% of Android, iOS, and Wi-Fi connected devices are potentially at risk. What can I do now for my organization and/or myself? The good news is there is a free solution that provides mobile Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections to ensure that KRACK or other network weaknesses cannot harm you. Creating a VPN Access to encrypt all internet communications will protect against any malicious network listeners making KRACK impotent, and even any man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Comodo Dome Shield includes Mobile VPN Profiles for iPads, iPhones and all types of Android devices. Dome Shield is the free level of the Dome product delivering web access controls and advanced threat protection to mobile users via these Mobile VPN Profiles. Simply configure the profile and your mobile device receives an extra level of security no matter what type of network is used. Comodo Dome Shield works seamlessly across Wi-Fi, or 2G, 3G, 4G, and LTE cellular networks and securely protects an average of 49 million transactions per day across 84 countries. How do I get Comodo Dome Shield? If you do not have Comodo Dome Shield implemented already, you can obtain a free license at https://www.comodo.com/cdomeshield/freelicense/. Just begin by selecting your business type of (individual, enterprise or MSP), and it’s a breeze. I already use Comodo Dome Shield for our users; how do I configure a Mobile VPN Profile? Open your Comodo Dome Shield Portal and go to Configure > Objects > Mobile Devices and email the VPN Profile to your users. This emails the users with the VPN profile included as an attachment. Once the user installs the VPN profile attachment on the device, all internet traffic on the mobile devices is encrypted end to end. The mobile device will be secured against all advanced threats regardless of where you are connecting from on Wi-Fi or other network. The mobile device is then secure against KRACK and its effects.

"During its regularly scheduled April security update, Adobe overall issued 43 patches, including ones for 24 critical vulnerabilities in eight of its products. Adobe has fixed 24 critical arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities across multiple products, including Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash, and Adobe Shockwave Player. Overall, Adobe issued fixes for 43 different CVE numbers across eight different products, Tuesday, as part of a regularly-scheduled monthly security update. The company said that none of the vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild. Acrobat Reader, Adobe’s family of products allowing users to create and manage PDF files, had the bulk of security flaws that were patched, with 21 vulnerabilities overall, 11 of which were critical arbitrary code execution flaws. “Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS. These updates address critical and important vulnerabilities,” said Adobe in its update.  “Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.” These flaws exist in Acrobat Reader DC (2019.010.20098 and earlier versions), Acrobat Reader 2017 (2017.011.30127 and earlier versions) and Acrobat Reader DC Classic 2015 (2015.006.30482 and earlier versions) for Windows and macOS. Acrobat Reader critical flaws. The critical flaws include five out-of-bounds write flaws (CVE-2019-7111, CVE-2019-7118, CVE-2019-7119, CVE-2019-7120, CVE-2019-7124). Two type confusion flaws (CVE-2019-7117, CVE-2019-7128), two use-after-free flaws (CVE-2019-7088, CVE-2019-7112) and two heap overflow glitches (CVE-2019-7113, CVE-2019-7125). “The patch for Acrobat corrects 21 different CVEs,” said Dustin Childs, with Trend Micro’s Zero-Day Initiative, in a Patch Tuesday analysis. “The worst of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to completely take control of an affected system.” Adobe also fixed seven arbitrary code execution flaws in the Windows version of its Shockwave Player, which is its multimedia platform for building interactive multimedia applications and video games. Impacted are versions 12.3.4.204 and earlier: Users are urged to update to version 12.3.5.205. All seven (CVE-2019-7098, CVE-2019-7099, CVE-2019-7100, CVE-2019-7101, CVE-2019-7102, CVE-2019-7103, CVE-2019-7104) stemmed from memory corruption: “This update resolves multiple critical memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user,” said Adobe. Adobe also fixed critical flaws in Adobe Flash (a critical arbitrary code execution vulnerability, CVE-2019-7096, as well as an important information disclosure flaw CVE-2019-7108), its Adobe XD tool for designing and prototyping user experience for web and mobile apps (which had two critical arbitrary code execution glitches, CVE-2019-7105 and CVE-2019-7106), and InDesign (a critical arbitrary code execution flaw, CVE-2019-7107) Adobe Bridge CC, Adobe’s free digital asset management app, also had eight flaws, including two critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-7130, CVE-2019-7132) and six important information disclosure flaws. “The update for Bridge CC corrects eight CVEs – all of which were reported through the ZDI program,” said Childs. “Included are two Critical-rated remote code execution bugs that could allow an attacker run their code in the context of the logged-on user.” Also patched was an “important” flaw in Adobe Experience Manager Forms and a “moderate” severity vulnerability in Adobe Dreamweaver. The regularly-scheduled updates come on the heels of a somewhat sparse March update for Adobe, when the company patched only two critical flaws in Photoshop CC and Adobe Digital Editions. Earlier in March, Adobe also issued an emergency patch for a critical vulnerability in its ColdFusion service that was being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, CVE-2019-7816, exists in Adobe’s commercial rapid web application development platform, ColdFusion.

Adobe has fixed 24 critical arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities across multiple products, including Acrobat Reader, Adobe Flash, and Adobe Shockwave Player. Overall, Adobe issued fixes for 43 different CVE numbers across eight different products, Tuesday, as part of a regularly-scheduled monthly security update. The company said that none of the vulnerabilities are currently being exploited in the wild. Acrobat Reader, Adobe’s family of products allowing users to create and manage PDF files, had the bulk of security flaws that were patched, with 21 vulnerabilities overall, 11 of which were critical arbitrary code execution flaws. “Adobe has released security updates for Adobe Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS. These updates address critical and important vulnerabilities,” said Adobe in its update.  “Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.” These flaws exist in Acrobat Reader DC (2019.010.20098 and earlier versions), Acrobat Reader 2017 (2017.011.30127 and earlier versions) and Acrobat Reader DC Classic 2015 (2015.006.30482 and earlier versions) for Windows and macOS. Acrobat Reader critical flaws. The critical flaws include five out-of-bounds write flaws (CVE-2019-7111, CVE-2019-7118, CVE-2019-7119, CVE-2019-7120, CVE-2019-7124). Two type confusion flaws (CVE-2019-7117, CVE-2019-7128), two use-after-free flaws (CVE-2019-7088, CVE-2019-7112) and two heap overflow glitches (CVE-2019-7113, CVE-2019-7125). “The patch for Acrobat corrects 21 different CVEs,” said Dustin Childs, with Trend Micro’s Zero-Day Initiative, in a Patch Tuesday analysis. “The worst of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to completely take control of an affected system.” Adobe also fixed seven arbitrary code execution flaws in the Windows version of its Shockwave Player, which is its multimedia platform for building interactive multimedia applications and video games. Impacted are versions 12.3.4.204 and earlier: Users are urged to update to version 12.3.5.205. All seven (CVE-2019-7098, CVE-2019-7099, CVE-2019-7100, CVE-2019-7101, CVE-2019-7102, CVE-2019-7103, CVE-2019-7104) stemmed from memory corruption: “This update resolves multiple critical memory corruption vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user,” said Adobe. Adobe also fixed critical flaws in Adobe Flash (a critical arbitrary code execution vulnerability, CVE-2019-7096, as well as an important information disclosure flaw CVE-2019-7108), its Adobe XD tool for designing and prototyping user experience for web and mobile apps (which had two critical arbitrary code execution glitches, CVE-2019-7105 and CVE-2019-7106), and InDesign (a critical arbitrary code execution flaw, CVE-2019-7107) Adobe Bridge CC, Adobe’s free digital asset management app, also had eight flaws, including two critical remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-7130, CVE-2019-7132) and six important information disclosure flaws. “The update for Bridge CC corrects eight CVEs – all of which were reported through the ZDI program,” said Childs. “Included are two Critical-rated remote code execution bugs that could allow an attacker run their code in the context of the logged-on user.” Also patched was an “important” flaw in Adobe Experience Manager Forms and a “moderate” severity vulnerability in Adobe Dreamweaver. The regularly-scheduled updates come on the heels of a somewhat sparse March update for Adobe, when the company patched only two critical flaws in Photoshop CC and Adobe Digital Editions. Earlier in March, Adobe also issued an emergency patch for a critical vulnerability in its ColdFusion service that was being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability, CVE-2019-7816, exists in Adobe’s commercial rapid web application development platform, ColdFusion.

"Multiyear campaigns stretching back to at least 2014 have been seen using zero-days in region-specific software. LONDON — Three separate, multi-year APT campaigns targeting region-specific software showcase a savvy technique of leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in niche software in order to infect victims with malware. According to researchers at JPCERT in Japan, speaking at Virus Bulletin 2019, both the APT17 and Bronze Butler threat groups have carried out ongoing campaigns that use the same techniques, swapping out exploits as new exploits are developed. The targets of the attacks are generally Japanese government agencies and vertical organizations, including education organizations, researchers said, with the most recent malicious activity seen in April 2019. According to JPCERT researchers Tomoaki Tani and Shusei Tomonaga, the regional software targeted by the APTs includes Sanshiro (a spreadsheet application similar to Microsoft Excel, which was discontinued in 2014 but still used across Japan); Ichitaro (a word processing, software similar to Microsoft Word); and SkySea Client View (an enterprise asset-management tool). When it comes to Sanshiro, major campaigns from APT17 leveraged a zero-day exploit for an arbitrary code execution vulnerability (CVE-2014-0810), spread in malicious documents attached to spearphishing emails. It began its routine when the user opened the software; and the endgame was the delivery of the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT). “This exploit was shared in several campaigns, and perhaps the actor was the same in all of them,” said Tani, speaking in a Wednesday session at Virus Bulletin 2019. “Further analysis showed that PlugX was used in other attacks, with each sample resolving to the same command-and-control server address.” A similar effort targeted Ichitaro, which was used in a multi-year campaign starting in 2014 dubbed Blue Termite. It affected more than 100 organizations across Japan; here, another zero-day code-execution exploit (CVE-2014-7247) was used in spearphishing campaigns to spread a triumvirate of malware: PlugX and two bots, Emdivi and Agtid. The bots can upload and download files from the victim’s computer. JPCERT also observed attacks likely carried out by an APT called Bronze Butler, making use of the SkySea Client View software, which is an asset-management software. It contains a vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836) that was exploited as a zero-day campaign in 2016 – and it was seen continuing through February 2019. It was used to execute the NodeRAT multiplatform backdoor malware, which is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js; and the Wali downloader application. This attack is linked, researchers suspect, to an April 2019 effort targeting a vulnerability in the Virus Buster Corporate Edition from Trend Micro, which is popular in Japan. In all cases, the campaigns were aimed at infiltrating target networks, moving laterally and stealing data, in classic APT fashion. The takeaway from the research is that APT groups are actively targeting niche attack surfaces in hopes of flying under the radar of defenders. While these particular attacks occurred in Japan, the same approach would prove effective elsewhere, according to Tani. “Targeted attacks against Japanese organizations exploited three different vulnerabilities in software that’s used only in Japan,” Tani concluded. “Nonetheless, these APT groups investigated this software and leveraged them for attacks. Unlike more popular software, it is often the case that countermeasures against vulnerabilities in such regional attacks are not well-prepared. Attackers understand this and aim for such weak points.” What are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

"D-Link’s DCS­930L Wi-Fi camera is vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability that can be remotely exploited. D-Link is wrestling with a vulnerability in its DCS­930L Wi-Fi camera that was privately disclosed by security company Senrio. The flaw exposes the cameras to remote code execution, a Senrio report says. CEO Stephen Ridley told Threatpost that his company is working with D-Link on remediation. D-Link, meanwhile, said in a statement emailed to Threatpost: “Security is the highest priority for D-Link and we are proactively working with the source of the report since receiving the inquiry to ensure that any vulnerabilities discovered are addressed. Once information and testing is completed, additional information will be made available to customers online at www.mydlink.com.” The vulnerability is a stack overflow in software running on the camera, specifically a service that processes remote commands, Senrio said in its report. “The vulnerability allows code injection and causes a password reset, granting the attacker remote access to the camera feed,” Senrio said. “Thus, even if users create a strong password, this type of vulnerability can override them.” The researchers believe that given where the flaw was found, its likely this vulnerability could be present in other product lines using the same software subsystem. An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network could find and exploit the flaw in the camera. Ridley said this is primarily a consumer device, but he’s aware of some companies that will use the cameras inside a network operations center. “The device itself is another network device,” he said. “There are a lot of edge use-cases we’re seeing. Because of the nature of these devices, two things are happening: People are putting them in places where they need to access them over the Internet. And they’re connecting them to the network accessing the feed from places they shouldn’t be relative to the security of the network such as the public Internet.” Attackers, he said, can use exploits as a initial intrusion onto a network. “They pose a threat to network security and operational security,” Ridley said. Complicating matters, as with other embedded and connected devices, is the difficulty in updating them. D-Link, for example, does provide an interface where its devices can fetch firmware and software updates from the Internet. Other so-called Internet of Things devices don’t have the same types of update features, and require instead manual installation of firmware updates. “Most of these devices are not secure, and if patches are available, they hardly ever make it to devices in the field,” Ridley said. : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1021 Remote Services","<s>[INST] D-Link’s DCS­930L Wi-Fi camera is vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability that can be remotely exploited.

"Reading Time: 2 minutes With a heavy flow of new security threats targeting the organizations for their data and money, IT security experts at organizations are finding it a daunting task to deny the ever-evolving sophisticated threats. A web security gateway is a product for any organization’s security. Implementing, configuring and maintaining a secure web gateway affects the level of security and how effective it provides. In this article we will discuss about how web security gateway works to secure the organization from threats. Read on to know more.. Choosing the right strategy to deploy a web security gateway One main factor that influences in protecting your organization’s network is by choosing the right Secure Web Gateway with the right set of features that includes • HTTPS scanning • URL Filtering • Threat Intelligence feeds • Mobile Support • Data Loss Prevention • Application Control • Threat and Traffic Visualization Organization should frame strict security objectives understanding the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation and strategies to be followed. This would entitle the organization to gain more benefits of a web secure gateway. Cloud-based Web Security Gateway is taking its phase of popularity and the growing interest seems to outweigh the on-premise system.. There is also an option to deploy a combination of cloud and on-premise which is becoming common too.  Integrating a Web Security Gateway with other Endpoint Security Products Secondly, before deploying a Web Security Gateway, it is vital to have a check on the security controls. It is also important to understand the purpose of the other security devices on the network and for what they are installed and configured to mitigate. Also understand the rules and filters they implement to ensure security policies. Never fail to educate employees on the recent social media attacks. Above all check if it is easy to integrate web security gateway with the existing endpoint security products to avoid interruption in delivering network protection. Mapping Acceptable Use and Compliance Policies to Rule Sets  Organizations should look into the usage of social website and take control over the same. Web Security Gateway can streamline the security process by enforcing to practice strict rules and security policies to comprehend the flow of traffic. It gives granular level of control on specific applications.  Setting up a Standard Procedure for Reviewing and Examining the Alerts and Enhancing Rule Sets When a specific rule is not followed, there is an alert provided by the web security gateway. It is critical and inevitable to prioritize events, if you have to deal with multiple incidents. Incidents that involve highly valuable business-related data and those that can be easily compromised should be prioritized first and investigated immediately. Evaluating the effectiveness of Secure Web gateway is done by monitoring the type and the number of incidents and the alerts as well. Visually mapping and regular tracking of the type of traffic would entitle IT admins to mitigate the false alerts.

"Netgear has built beta firmware updates for its Nighthawk routers vulnerable to a command injection attack disclosed last week. Netgear has begun pushing out beta versions of firmware updates that will address a critical vulnerability that was disclosed late last week. The networking vendor also confirmed that many more routers in its Nighthawk line are vulnerable than originally reported. The flaw allows attackers to carry out command injection attacks, and are reportedly trivial to exploit. “While we are working on the production version of the firmware, we are providing a beta version of this firmware release. This beta firmware has not been fully tested and might not work for all users,” Netgear said an advisory updated today. “NETGEAR is offering this beta firmware release as a temporary solution, but NETGEAR strongly recommends that all users download the production version of the firmware release as soon as it is available.” A researcher who goes by the handle of AceW0rm said he disclosed the vulnerability in August, and that the report was never acknowledged by Netgear, therefore he decided to go public on Friday. “This is very trivial because the attacker does not even need a special tool or anything of that nature; all they need is a web browser,” AceW0rm told Threatpost. “An attack could be a full takeover of the router, and the attacker could do anything.” In the original public disclosure, only two Nighthawk router versions were deemed vulnerable, but a researcher known as Kalypto Pink tested additional models and found a long list of vulnerable routers: the R6400; R7000; R7000P; R7500; R7800; R8000; R8500; and R9000. Netgear, meanwhile, today posted a similar list of products it has tested and confirmed vulnerable: R6250; R6400; R6700; R7000; R7100LG; R7300; R7900; R8000. Beta firmware, Netgear said, is available for the R6250, R6400, R6700, R7000 and R8000 models. “NETGEAR is continuing to review our entire portfolio for other routers that might be affected by this vulnerability,” the vendor said in its advisory. “If any other routers are affected by the same security vulnerability, we plan to release firmware to fix those as well.” The DHS-sponsored CERT/CC at Carnegie Mellon University went to so far as to caution users to discontinue using the affected routers until updated firmware was made available. “A fix would be very easy and would likely only be a line or two of code,” AceW0rm said. CERT, meanwhile, has updated its advisory, and spelled out that the routers are affected by two other vulnerabilities in addition to command injection, including cross-site request forgery, and missing authentication mechanisms. “By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web site, a remote unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers,” CERT said. The organization also recommended two mitigations in addition to discontinuing use of the vulnerable devices. One was to disable the router’s web server with the following command: http://<router_IP>/cgi-bin/;killall$IFS’httpd‘ This will also shut down the router’s administration interface until the device is restarted, CERT said. Another option would be to disable remote administration, which is the avenue by which the available exploit works. “Enabling remote administration allows affected routers to be exploited via direct requests from the WAN,” CERT said.

CERT, meanwhile, has updated its advisory, and spelled out that the routers are affected by two other vulnerabilities in addition to command injection, including cross-site request forgery, and missing authentication mechanisms. “By convincing a user to visit a specially crafted web site, a remote unauthenticated attacker may execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on affected routers,” CERT said. The organization also recommended two mitigations in addition to discontinuing use of the vulnerable devices. One was to disable the router’s web server with the following command: http://<router_IP>/cgi-bin/;killall$IFS’httpd‘ This will also shut down the router’s administration interface until the device is restarted, CERT said. Another option would be to disable remote administration, which is the avenue by which the available exploit works. “Enabling remote administration allows affected routers to be exploited via direct requests from the WAN,” CERT said. Netgear has links to all of its available beta firmware versions on its advisory page. : IoT Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services </s>"
"The newly discovered Python-based malware family targets the Outlook processes, and browser credentials, of Microsoft Windows victims. Researchers have discovered a new information-stealing trojan, which targets Microsoft Windows systems with an onslaught of data-exfiltration capabilities– from collecting browser credentials to targeting Outlook files. The trojan, called PyMicropsia (due to it being built with Python) has been developed by threat group AridViper, researchers said, which is known for targeting organizations in the Middle East. “AridViper is an active threat group that continues developing new tools as part of their arsenal,” researchers with Palo Alto’s Unit42 research team said in a Monday analysis. “Also, based on different aspects of PyMicropsia that we analyzed, several sections of the malware are still not used, indicating that it is likely a malware family under active development by this actor.” Click to register. The trojan’s information-stealing capabilities include file uploading, payload downloading/execution, browser-credential stealing (and the ability to clear browsing history and profiles), taking screenshots and keylogging. In addition, the malware can collect file listing information, delete files, reboot machines, collect information from USB drive and record audio; as well as harvest Outlook .OST files and kill/ disable Outlook processes. An OST file, also known as an Offline Outlook Data File, is used by Microsoft accounts, Exchange accounts and Outlook.com accounts “to store a synchronized copy of your mailbox information on your local computer,” according to Microsoft. OST files may contain email messages, contacts, tasks, calendar data and other account information. The Trojan The trojan has been made into a Windows executable by PyInstaller, a Python package allowing applications into stand-alone executables. Once downloaded, the malware “implements its main functionality by running a loop, where it initializes different threads and calls several tasks periodically with the intent of collecting information and interacting with the C2 operator,” according to researchers. The threat actor uses both built-in Python libraries and specific packages for information-stealing purposes – including PyAudio (enabling audio stealing capabilities) and mss (allowing screenshot capabilities). “The usage of Python built-in libraries is expected for multiple purposes, such as interacting with Windows processes, Windows registry, networking, file system and so on,” said researchers. PyMicropsia has relations to the Micropsia malware family, another AridViper malware known for targeting Microsoft Windows . These links include code overlaps; similar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), such as the use of rar.exe to compress data for exfiltration; and similar command-and-control (C2) communication URI path structures. Micropsia has also made references to specific themes in code and C2 implementations – including previous references to TV shows like The Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones. Of note, in PyMicropsia’s code variables, researchers found references to multiple famous actor names, actors Fran Drescher and Keanu Reeves, which “seems in line with previous observations of themes,” said researchers. AridViper: Active Development While investigating PyMicropsia’s capabilities, researchers said they also identified two additional samples hosted in the attacker’s infrastructure. The additional samples, which are downloaded and used by the trojan during its deployment, provide persistence and keylogging capabilities. They are not Python/ PyInstaller based. While PyMicropsia is designed to target Windows operating systems only, researchers found snippets in the code that check for other operating systems (such as “posix” or “darwin”). Posix, or the Portable Operating System Interface, is a family of standards used for maintaining compatibility between operating systems; and Darwin an open-source Unix-like operating system. “This is an interesting finding, as we have not witnessed AridViper targeting these operating systems before and this could represent a new area the actor is starting to explore,” they said. “For now, the code found is very simple, and could be part of a copy and paste effort when building the Python code, but in any case, we plan to keep it on our radar while researching new activity.” This article was updated on Oct. 15 at 2pm ET to reflect a more accurate description of OST files.

"Verizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report for 2017 shows big growth in the reported number of ransomware attacks and incidents involving cyberespionage. Ransomware dominated malware-related data breaches investigated by Verizon last year, appearing in 71 percent of cases, according to the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) released Thursday. Compared to last year’s DBIR report, ransomware attacks are up 50 percent. Still, Verizon suspects the true number of ransomware attacks and victims is likely going under reported. The DBIR, an analysis of more than 40,000 incidents (including 1,935 breaches) investigated by Verizon, shows that cybercriminals targeted manufacturing, the public sector and education the most, but Verizon senior network engineer Dave Hylender said the healthcare industry was hit the hardest with ransomware. “Organized criminal groups continue to utilize ransomware to extort money from their victims, and since a data disclosure in these incidents is often not confirmed, they are not reflected in statistical data,” Verizon wrote. Last year, ransomware attacks against healthcare organizations dominated headlines such a Locky ransomware attack against the hospital chain MedStar and Samsam ransomware attacks that crippled two California hospitals. Last year also saw the emergence of new types of ransomware and ransomware business models, with the DBIR citing Petya and Mischa specifically.   “Ransomware has evolved over the past year,” Hylender said. “We are seeing new strains with new attributes.” Instead of immediately infecting and encrypting data, criminals are now taking their time infiltrate systems and targeting high-value data with ransomware, he said. “Ransomware gangs are using unforeseen and unusual command lines and are using new packaging techniques for their malware so they can evade detection,” Hylender said. Last year there was no shortage of unique ransomware from those that used fileless attack techniques, to campaigns that coupled elaborate phishing attacks with complex malicious Word macros. The 2017 DBIR also singles out cyberespionage and APTs as a prevalent threat. Verizon said 21 percent of breaches last year were tied to organized nation-state groups that dominated headlines such as Fancy Bear, Equation Group and Turla. State-affiliated actors were responsible for a quarter of recorded phishing attacks, up from nine percent last year. “Targeted phishing campaigns continue to be the tip of the spear for espionage-related breaches,” Verizon wrote. Hardest sectors hit by cyberespionage were manufacturing (representing 38 percent of attacks investigated by Verizon), public (34 percent), professional (9 percent) and education (7 percent), according to the DBIR. The interesting change in the DBIR is the rise of academia as a target of these attacks, Hylender said. Colleges are centers of innovation and are building technologies that would certainly be targeted by state affiliated groups, he said. “Criminals are realizing that intellectual property and trade secrets are being held by institutions of higher learning. And, state actors are realizing it’s easier to break into a university system and steal the R&D there than break into a government system or a well-developed and well-protected manufacturer’s system,” Hylender said. In the report, Verizon offers several words of advice for business. One, don’t go out of your way to give hackers a reason to attack you. “Stay off the radar of any potential hacker,” Verizon said. It also suggests keeping an ear to the ground when it comes to understanding the type of defenses needed based on reliable threat intelligence. And then, there is the obvious – secure your environment. “Implement a timely and effective patch management program; conduct regular penetration-testing activities,” it suggests. Verizon also recommends implementing two-factor authentication and offering security awareness training for staffs. “People are still not using two-factor authentication and hackers are still using brute force passwords attacks. There are all sorts of things we tell people to do to be more secure. Nevertheless, people continue to practice poor security hygiene. Will things change next year?

"Three separate proof-of-concepts on Bash, Python and Ruby posted to outsmart fix issued last year to remedy pre-auth RCE bug. A security researcher has published proof-of-concept code to outsmart a patch issued last year for a zero-day vulnerability discovered in vBulletin, a popular software for building online community forums. Calling a patch for the flaw a “fail” and  “inadequate in blocking exploitation,” Austin-based security researcher Amir Etemadieh published details and examples of exploit code on three developer platforms– Bash, Python and Ruby–for the patch in a post published Sunday night. On September 23, 2019, an unidentified security researcher released exploit code for a flaw that allowed for PHP remote code execution in vBulletin 5.0 through 5.4, Etemadieh wrote. Click to register! The zero-day, CVE-2019-16759, is called a pre-auth RCE bug, which can allow an attacker to run malicious code and take over forums without needing to authenticate on the sites that are under attack. “This bug (CVE-2019-16759) was labeled as a ‘bugdoor’ because of its simplicity by a popular vulnerability broker and was marked with a CVSS 3.x score of 9.8 giving it a critical rating,” he said in the post. A patch was issued two days later, Sept. 25, 2019, that “seemed, at the time, to fix the proof of concept exploit provided by the un-named finder,” Etemadieh said. It appears that it didn’t however, as Etemadieh outlined how it can be bypassed on the three developer platforms in three separate proof-of-concepts. The key problem with the patch issued for the zero day is related to how the vBulletin template system is structured and how it uses PHP, he wrote in the post. “Templates aren’t actually written in PHP but instead are written in a language that is first processed by the template engine and then is output as a string of PHP code that is later ran through an eval() during the ‘rendering’ process,” according to the post. “Templates are also not a standalone item but can be nested within other templates, in that one template can have a number of child templates embedded within.” The patch is “short-sighted” because it faces problems when encountering a user-controlled child template, Etemadieh wrote. In this case, a parent template will be checked to verify that the routestring does not end with a widget_php route, Etemadieh said. “However we are still prevented from providing a payload within the widgetConfig value because of code within the rendering process, which cleans the widgetConfig value prior to the templates execution,” he wrote in his post. Etemadieh goes on to show how another template that appears in the patch is “a perfect assistant in bypassing the previous CVE-2019-16759 patch” thanks to two key features: the template’s ability to load a user-controlled child template, and how it loads the child template by taking a value from a separately named value and placing it into a variable named “widgetConfig.” “These two characteristics of the ‘widget_tabbedcontainer_tab_panel’ template allow us to effectively bypass all filtering previously done to prevent CVE-2019-16759 from being exploited,” he wrote. It’s unclear if Etemadieh informed vBulletin before posting the workarounds; however, a report in ZDNet suggests that he did not. No matter, he did provide a quick fix for his bypass of the patch in his post, showing how to disable PHP widgets within vBulletin forums that “may break some functionality but will keep you safe from attacks until a patch is released by vBulletin,” he wrote. To apply the fix, administrators should: Go to the vBulletin administrator control panel. Click “Settings” in the menu on the left, then “Options” in the dropdown. Choose “General Settings” and then click “Edit Settings” Look for “Disable PHP, Static HTML, and Ad Module rendering”, Set to “Yes” Click “Save” Online forums are a popular target for hackers because of they typically have a wide and diverse user base and store a large amount of personally identifiable information about those users. Indeed, hackers wasted no time in using Etemadieh’s bypass to try to hack into the forum at the DEF CON security conference, according to a post on Twitter by DEFCON and Black Hat founder Jeff Moss. However, administrators quickly applied Etemadieh’s advice to disable PHP to thwart the attack, he tweeted. “Disable PHP rendering to protect yourself until patched!” Moss advised.

"Part 1. KSN Report: PC ransomware in 2014-2016 Download PDF versionThe activity of mobile ransomware, although not as widely covered in the media as PC ransomware, also skyrocketed over the period covered by this report. Especially in the second half.Fig. 12: The number of users encountering mobile ransomware at least once in the period April 2014 to March 2016From April 2014 to March 2015, Kaspersky Lab security solutions for Android protected 35,413 users from mobile ransomware. A year later the number had increased almost four-fold to136,532 users. The share of users attacked with ransomware as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of malware also increased: from 2.04% in 2014-2015 to 4.63% in 2015-2016. The growth curve may be less that that seen for PC ransomware, but it is still significant enough to confirm a worrying trend.The geography of mobile ransomware is quite similar to the one for PC ransomware, with a few notable differences. In 2014-2015 the percentage of mobile users attacked with ransomware was fairly low, much lower than that seen for PCs.Fig. 13: Top 10 countries with the highest percentage of mobile users attacked with malware Trojan-Ransom category as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of mobile malware. (Each country has more than 5,000 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products for Android devices). Period: April 2014 – March 2015.As can be seen in Fig. 13, in 2014-2015 the list of countries where users were most likely to encounter mobile ransomware looked very different to the one based on data for PC users. The United States led the chart with 10.4% of users attacked with ransomware, followed by Kazakhstan (7.8%) Ukraine (6.7%) and Germany (4.5%). Russia was lower down the top ten list, mostly because the local threat landscape at the time was highly affected by Trojan-SMS malware.In 2015-2016, the list changed significantly, both in terms of the order of countries and in the proportion of users encountering ransomware.Fig. 14: Top 10 countries with the highest percentage of mobile users attacked with malware in the Trojan-Ransom category as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of mobile malware. (Each country has more than 5,000 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products for Android devices.) Period: April 2015 – March 2016.Germany became the leader with 22.9% of attacked users, followed by Canada (19.61%), the UK (16.13%) and the US (15.64%).Clearly the target profile of mobile ransomware is dramatically different to the one for PC ransomware. It is hard to say precisely why this is the case, but we can assume that in countries that feature at the top of the mobile ransomware list, mobile and e-payment infrastructure is much more developed and has deeper penetration than in countries that are at the bottom of the list or not on it at all. Criminals like to get as close to their victim’s money as possible and attacking a user who can transfer the ransom in couple of taps or clicks is likely to have the most appeal.Across the whole period covered by the report, Kaspersky Lab researchers were able to identify a few families of mobile ransomware that users of our products encountered most often. In 2014-2015 these were: Pletor, Fusob, Svpeng and Small. In 2015-2016, Svpeng significantly reduced its activity hitting just a small share of the attacked users.At some point during 2014-2015, Svpeng – originally known as a banking malware – was modified by its creators to be able to lock an infected device. Since then we have tracked both versions of Svpeng: the banking one and the ransomware. The ransomware branch gained visibly in popularity during 2014-2015, accounting for 5.64% of users attacked with any malware.This changed during the second period, with the ransomware dropping to the lower end of the Top 30 threats. However, the banking branch of Svpeng resumed activity, which probably means that the malware creators simply lost interest in developing the ransomware and decided to concentrate on the banking one.Roughly the same thing happened to Pletor – the malware considered to be the first example of ransomware and allegedly created by the authors of the infamous Acecard banking Trojan. In 2014-2015 it secured a fairly visible share of the pie of mobile users attacked with ransomware, but by 2015-2016 it had disappeared from the top, leaving only three big ransomware families on the “market”.Fig. 15: The distribution of the share of attacked users between the most active mobile ransomware families in 2014-2015 (left) in comparison to the one in 2015-2016 (right).Another significant thing seen during the 24 months covered by the report was the competition between two big ransomware families: Small and Fusob. In 2014-2015, the Small family was the leader, at least in terms of the share of attacked users. It accounted for 69.11% of all users encountering mobile ransomware at least once. But a year later, the Fusob family had taken over the lead hitting 56.25% of users. The Small family, however, remained number two with 37.23% of attacked users. The Svpeng, Pletor, Small and Fusob malware are likely to be sold by their authors to other cybercriminals or propagated through affiliate networks – all four families have undergone a lot of modifications. However, Small and Fusob appear to have been modified the most and this is clearly visible in the statistics.Unlike PC ransomware, which is already relatively widely covered by researchers from different companies, including Kaspersky Lab, mobile ransomware has so far not been researched in depth. In order to address this, we provide a brief description of the most widespread and dangerous mobile ransomware examples as of April 2016.In April 2016, Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Fusob became the most popular mobile Trojan: users in more than 100 countries worldwide were attacked by this Trojan-Ransom program. The first samples of Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Fusob were discovered by Kaspersky Lab experts in early January 2015.Fig. 16: Message displayed by Fusob ransomwareTrojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Fusob was most actively distributed in the following countries:Fig.16: The percentage of users attacked with Fusob ransomware as a proportion of all users attacked with any kind of mobile ransomwareOnce the Trojan is executed [?], it runs a check of the device language (Locale.getDefault().getCountry()), and for the following countries it will not perform any malicious actions:If the country is not included in the list, the Trojan asks for device administrator rights and displays a message notifying the user that the device is being updated. The device can be still used, but the Trojan blocks access to the device settings by overlaying them with its own window. This is how it protects itself from being removed.Meanwhile, the Trojan collects information about the device and sends it to the attackers. In doing so, it uploads two different sets of data to the Command and Control (C&C) server. The first set of data contains information about the device, such as device model, the version of the operating system, etc. This data is encoded with the Base64 algorithm and uploaded to the criminals’ server. The second data set, among other things, contains the user location and the call log with names from the contact list. This set is encrypted by the AES algorithm and loaded to a malicious C&C server.The Trojan then waits for the attackers’ command with the necessary data to block the device.For this purpose, the Trojan uses an HTML file received from the C&C. The Trojan itself includes functionality that can be activated from this file.Fig. 17: A fragment of Fusob ransomware’s codeAmong several functions integrated into the Trojan, two functions cause particular concern. They are: getImage(), which takes a photo with the help of the device’s front camera, and inst() used to install a previously downloaded APK file.The criminals usually demand between $100 and $200 to unblock the device. The ransom has to be paid in the form of codes from pre-paid iTunes cards.Fig. 18. The dialog window to enter the code of the gift card in exchange for unlocking the deviceThis family is mainly spread via porn sites; its representatives usually appearing under the name xxxPlayer and mimicking a multimedia player application used for watching porn videos.Fig. 19: An example of the kind of webpage through which the Fusob malware is distributedOn clicking the “Download App Now!” button, the Fusob ransom Trojan is downloaded onto the user’s device. Interestingly, after a while this site redirected us to another site, which began to extort $100 in a similar way to Fusob.Fig. 20: A web page that appears after the Fusob malware is downloaded.In addition, a number of cases have been registered recently where an exploit kit was used to deliver this Trojan to Android devices silently in the background.We have analyzed those sources of infection that were most active at the time of writing this report. Most of them are registered to email addresses in the yandex.ru domain. In addition, the majority of this Trojan’s C&C servers are hosted in Russia, or carry registration data that suggests the person who registered them speaks Russian. However, analysis of the large number of modifications of this Trojan, starting from the earliest incarnations, did not provide any evidence that could confirm the authors’ language. The only clue we could find in the code of the HTML file used to block the device is some commentary in Russian. All this, along with the fact that the Trojan doesn’t attack Russian users, suggests that either the authors of the Trojan or the criminals distributing it are Russian-speaking attackers.Fig. 21: A fragment of Fusob’s code pointing at the possible origin of its authorsIn April 2016, over 12% of attacked users were hit by representatives of the Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small family, which made it the second most popular ransomware Trojan family. It has been on our radar since mid-June 2014.Almost 99% of users attacked by this Trojan are located in just three countries:Fig. 22: Distribution of infection attempts by the Small ransomware in April 2016This family can be divided into three main groups:The first group of the Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small family includes small and very basic ransom Trojans. Once run, they ask for device administrator rights to prevent the Trojan from being removed. Immediately after that they display a message demanding a ransom which appears on the screen overlaying all other windows. This makes it impossible to use the device.Fig. 23: Message displayed by the Small ransomware (group 1)They mainly target Russian-speaking users and demand about 700 to 3,500 rubles to unblock the device. There are also samples targeting English-speaking users. Their functionality is similar, but they demand $300 to unblock the device.Fig. 24: Message displayed to English-speaking users by the Small ransomware (group 1)The second group from the Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small family are encryptors. Their functionality is almost identical to that described above – the only difference is the fact that after blocking the device, they start encrypting files on the memory card.Fig. 25: A fragment of code of the Small ransomwareThe third group of the Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small family is a multifunctional ransomware Trojan. Its behavior depends on the commands it receives from the C&C. Once run, the Trojan asks for the device administrator rights and loads information about the device to a malicious server. This information includes the phone number, the device model, the IMEI, and the version of the operating system. In addition, the Trojan is registered in the GCM system. The Trojan can receive commands from both the C&C and via GCM. It can perform the following commands:Once launched, the Trojan also intercepts incoming SMSs. It processes them in accordance with the rules received from the C&C. In addition, it can receive the following commands via SMS:In most cases we received similar commands to block the device with a ransom demand to the tune of 1900 rubles.“command”: “job”, “data”: {“command”: “LOCKER”, “data”:{“payMsg”: “To pay the fine, transfer no less than 1,900 rubles to the phone number: +79688343708 from any terminal to top up mobile accounts in Russia! “}}}”We also received several commands to send SMSs to the number of a major Russian bank. This trick can be used to steal money from a bank account if it is associated with the victim’s phone number.The ransomware Trojans of this family are mainly distributed via porn sites; however, we also registered them in SMS spam.The C&C registration data, the area where the Trojan is distributed, and the lines of Russian in its code suggest that the Trojan-Ransom.AndroidOS.Small family was developed by Russian-speaking writers.Over 97% of users attacked by this family of ransomware Trojans were located in the US. In April 2016, we detected this family in a total of 9 countries. We first discovered this ransomware Trojan family in June 2014 and believe it was created by the same attackers as the banking Trojan Svpeng.Once run, the Trojan requests device administrator rights. It then collects the information that it requires: the list of calls and the history of visited sites; it also takes a picture with the device camera. Then the Trojan blocks the device by overlaying all windows with an HTML file. With the help of this file it can get access to previously prepared information.Fig. 26: The message displayed by Svpeng ransomwareIn most cases the Trojan demands $500 to unblock the device. Like other groups of mobile ransomware, it is distributed via porn sites.Unlike PC ransomware, most of the mobile examples are rather simple blockers that use some of the technical features of the Android OS in order to show the window with the ransom message on top of other windows. From time to time Kaspersky Lab researchers discover examples of Android-ransomware capable of encrypting files on the infected device. However, Kaspersky Lab experts don’t believe that encryption ransomware for mobile will undergo any noticeable development in the future. This is because of the security features implemented recently into the Android OS, which limits the ability of third-party apps to get unlimited access to users’ files. Also, encryption is not as effective on mobile as it is on a PC, because the Android OS and popular Android apps often come with features that enable data to be backed-up automatically to the cloud, which is obviously not the case for PCs.In short, criminals targeting mobile devices don’t need to invest resources in the development of encryption malware, since the damage it can do is limited. The same cannot be said for classic blockers; these are much more efficient on a mobile device than on a PC. The difference is simple: if a PC user encounters blocker ransomware – even a sophisticated one – then in the worst case scenario they will be able to remove the hard drive from the infected PC, attach it to another PC and manually remove all malicious files. It is almost impossible to do the same with a mobile device as its hardware is impossible to remove easily and analyze with the help of an extraneous device.Perhaps this is the main reason why the mobile ransomware landscape is mostly a landscape of blockers.As mentioned before, crypto-ransomware has existed for years. Sporadic attempts to turn crypto-ransomware into a profitable business-model were spotted by Kaspersky Lab researchers as early as 2006 with the Gpcode ransomware family and the copycats that followed. The approach was standard: after a successful infection, the malicious program would show a ransom message and would demand money, usually a hundred dollars or so, sent through a bank transfer.Fig. 27: An example of a message left by criminals on a PC infected with Gpcode-like ransomware, from 2008But there was no big criminal-to-criminal industry behind those initial attempts to spread crypto-ransomware. Usually it was the work of a single criminal or a small group of criminals, and although in the period from 2006 to 2011, Gpcode or similar samples of crypto-ransomware appeared regularly on our radar, the intensity of attacks at that time cannot be compared with what we see today.Several years after the last waves of attacks with Gpcode and its followers, crypto-ransomware was chosen by big financial malware actors as a way of earning illegal income. Perhaps the brightest example of this trend was the infamous Gameover Zeus botnet. Originally created for stealing credentials in order to access online banking services, at some point the botnet creators started to use it to infect victims with Cryptolocker ransomware and demand a ransom. The damage done by this botnet was extensive, but luckily, in 2014, following an international effort led by Europol and the FBI, the botnet was shut down.Allegedly, the ransomware scheme was a sort of side business for the creators of the botnet – a way of monetizing those PCs in the botnet that had no access to online banking systems. A few other groups of criminals known for spreading financial malware have also been spotted undertaking crypto-ransomware activities. But at the end of the day, this model hasn’t become widespread and it is not what brought crypto-ransomware to the level of attacks that we see today.It is no secret that most of today’s crypto-ransomware has Russian roots, both in terms of the authors of the malicious code and of the actors who spread the malware and demand the ransom. The groups behind ransomware attacks are mainly small or medium-sized and they cooperate by means of a business scheme: affiliate networks.Small groups often consist of non-professional but very motivated members willing to invest money and time into any cybercriminal activity promising money. Middle-sized groups usually contain some professional programmers and web technology specialists. They are able to produce malware and to build and support the IT infrastructure that forms the technological backbone for the malware.Over the last few years, middle-sized groups have been able to create several “products” that, in the case of ransomware comprise a kind of DIY set that less-skilled criminals can buy, modify into their own unique version of the malware, and then use to make money. For this they would tune the set in order to make it work with certain C&C servers, encrypt files with certain keys etc. After that they would either try to spread the newly-created malware themselves (investing additional money into buying traffic, spam mailings or renting exploit-kits), or would urge other criminals – entry-level ones – to do this through affiliate programs.Through this business scheme, multiple affiliates receive a unique version of the malware from the owner of the affiliate network, and take charge of its distribution: spreading it through websites, spam and other ways of propagation. Every time a victim infected with such malware pays the ransom, the affiliate receives some cash from the owner of the network, who gets the lion’s share of the ransom.There is nothing new in the affiliate network business model being used by cybercriminals in order to ease the propagation of malware. In the past, this model has been used to propagate Blockers, SMS-Trojans and of course banking Trojans, along with thousands of different adware and pornware strings.Fig. 28: A description of the capabilities that the affiliate program would give a participant. Along with s strong encryption algorithm, this affiliate program offers its partners a user-friendly interface for a landing page in a Tor-network which would serve as a web-proxy for ransom transactionsThis business model appears to be more viable for ransomware than for any other type of malware. The main reason for this is the fact that victims of ransomware tend to pay for releasing their files and thereby pour money into the underground economy of cybercrime.First and foremost, because users pay.It seems that in recent years regular users and companies have reached the point where the information stored on their PC is valuable enough to consider paying a ransom on demand. The massive transition in organizations towards the use of digital documents and automated business processes for accounting and other day-to-day activities is helping to accelerate this. A company whose tax documentation, for example is encrypted with ransomware just before the deadline for submitting returns to the tax regulator, has no choice but to pay the ransom – and this is what criminals exploit. As a result, crypto-ransomware has become, almost uniquely, a type of malware that can cause tangible business damage by making critical operational files unreadable. This damage cannot not always be rolled back, so sometimes paying the ransom is the only way to retrieve the data.Another important factor which has positively affected the rise of ransomware is the appearance of new payment tools. New crypto-currencies, for example are now often accompanied by how-to-use guides “for dummies” that teach mainstream users how to use such currencies.In the past, cybercriminals tended to use either legitimate payment systems or semi-legitimate services in order to transfer money to each other and from their victims. The problem for criminals is that legitimate payment systems, reacting to the rise in fraudulent payments, have started to track and block suspicious transactions, making money transfer a far more risky business for cyber-crooks.With underground and semi-legal payment systems the problem is that no guarantees are given to the users of such systems (no refunds, no protection from other criminals) and the privacy of these transactions is also always questionable. At the end of the day the fate of each known underground payment system (from E-gold to Liberty Reserve) is always the same: sooner or later it goes down, due to a law enforcement investigation or some other reason.That is why money transaction for cybercriminals has always been an area of risk. But things changed significantly when the price of crypto-currencies – bitcoin in particular – rose and stabilized enough to allow a lot of users to convert real money. Criminals have started to exploit the advantages crypto-currencies over other type of e-currency: anonymity and a distributed nature, which both allow them to hide fraudulent transactions and make it impossible for a law enforcement agency to do anything, as the system has no center and no owner. These features help to support individual privacy rights but, unfortunately also give cybercriminals a very reliable and secret payment tool. The main outcome of this is that ransomware has become the new black in the underground.It has acquired a fairly viable criminal ecosystem where, powered by money from attacked users, specific niches for different types of criminals have emerged. Affiliate networks have become the main way for all of them to generate profit. And – what is more dangerous – they have opened doors to the criminal world for those who doesn’t have enough knowledge and expertise to develop their own ransomware. With multiple affiliate networks on the market, they need only basic skills in programming and web design.Another important reason for the rise in crypto-ransomware is the fact that law enforcement can find it difficult to respond. Most victims of cryptors are ordinary people who do not always report the attack to the police. This leaves law enforcement agencies and forensic experts with a very limited amount of evidence to work with: law enforcement representatives generally have too few reported cases to justify an investigation, and forensic specialists lack enough actual evidence to use against the actors behind crypto-ransomware. At Kaspersky Lab we are eager to change this situation and we are ready to help law enforcement agencies and other interested organizations with technical analyses of malware. The pressure of the law is a valuable tool in the fight against ransomware. This was proven by the case against the criminals who spread screen blocker malware in 2010. The arrests that took place in August 2010 in Russia showed other cyber-criminals that the consequences of their actions could be severe. The wave of screen blockers started to fade after those arrests and we believe that the same approach would work with crypto-ransomware criminals.Based on the statistics and trends described in this report, we were able to come to the following conclusions:Alongside these conclusions we believe that the current ransomware threat landscape provides a good basis for several predictions on how this threat will evolve in the future.Predictions:As legal action is one of the few way to actually disrupt the activity of groups behind crypto-ransomware, more arrests of ransomware dealers will take place. In 2015, Kaspersky Lab assisted the Dutch police in the investigation of the CoinVault ransomware attacks. The result of this investigation was the arrest of two suspects and the publication of decryption keys online.New arrests are a must for an effective fight against crypto-ransomware as they significantly increase the risks for criminals embarking on such malicious activity.While crypto-ransomware is one of the most dangerous types of malware ever created, and the consequences of it could be really severe, we at Kaspersky Lab believe that there are ways to protect yourself or your organization against this threat.Tips to consumers:Tips to businessesKaspersky Lab offers multi-layered protection against this widespread increasing threat. Kaspersky Lab’s solutions combat all known types of ransomware to secure user’s data. When these solutions are in place, most ransomware is “caught” when it is attempting to penetrate a device. Nonetheless, even if malware does manage to sneak through, there is another layer of protection – System Watcher technology – that is able to block and roll back malicious changes made on a device, such as the encryption of files or blocked access to the monitor.","T1486 Data Encrypted for Impact,T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] Part 1. KSN Report: PC ransomware in 2014-2016 Download PDF versionThe activity of mobile ransomware, although not as widely covered in the media as PC ransomware, also skyrocketed over the period covered by this report. Especially in the second half.Fig. 12: The number of users encountering mobile ransomware at least once in the period April 2014 to March 2016From April 2014 to March 2015, Kaspersky Lab security solutions for Android protected 35,413 users from mobile ransomware. A year later the number had increased almost four-fold to136,532 users. The share of users attacked with ransomware as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of malware also increased: from 2.04% in 2014-2015 to 4.63% in 2015-2016. The growth curve may be less that that seen for PC ransomware, but it is still significant enough to confirm a worrying trend.The geography of mobile ransomware is quite similar to the one for PC ransomware, with a few notable differences. In 2014-2015 the percentage of mobile users attacked with ransomware was fairly low, much lower than that seen for PCs.Fig. 13: Top 10 countries with the highest percentage of mobile users attacked with malware Trojan-Ransom category as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of mobile malware. (Each country has more than 5,000 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products for Android devices). Period: April 2014 – March 2015.As can be seen in Fig. 13, in 2014-2015 the list of countries where users were most likely to encounter mobile ransomware looked very different to the one based on data for PC users. The United States led the chart with 10.4% of users attacked with ransomware, followed by Kazakhstan (7.8%) Ukraine (6.7%) and Germany (4.5%). Russia was lower down the top ten list, mostly because the local threat landscape at the time was highly affected by Trojan-SMS malware.In 2015-2016, the list changed significantly, both in terms of the order of countries and in the proportion of users encountering ransomware.Fig. 14: Top 10 countries with the highest percentage of mobile users attacked with malware in the Trojan-Ransom category as a proportion of users attacked with any kind of mobile malware. (Each country has more than 5,000 unique users of Kaspersky Lab products for Android devices.) Period: April 2015 – March 2016.Germany became the leader with 22.9% of attacked users, followed by Canada (19.61%), the UK (16.13%) and the US (15.64%).Clearly the target profile of mobile ransomware is dramatically different to the one for PC ransomware. It is hard to say precisely why this is the case, but we can assume that in countries that feature at the top of the mobile ransomware list, mobile and e-payment infrastructure is much more developed and has deeper penetration than in countries that are at the bottom of the list or not on it at all. Criminals like to get as close to their victim’s money as possible and attacking a user who can transfer the ransom in couple of taps or clicks is likely to have the most appeal.Across the whole period covered by the report, Kaspersky Lab researchers were able to identify a few families of mobile ransomware that users of our products encountered most often. In 2014-2015 these were: Pletor, Fusob, Svpeng and Small. In 2015-2016, Svpeng significantly reduced its activity hitting just a small share of the attacked users.At some point during 2014-2015, Svpeng – originally known as a banking malware – was modified by its creators to be able to lock an infected device. Since then we have tracked both versions of Svpeng: the banking one and the ransomware. The ransomware branch gained visibly in popularity during 2014-2015, accounting for 5.64% of users attacked with any malware.This changed during the second period, with the ransomware dropping to the lower end of the Top 30 threats. However, the banking branch of Svpeng resumed activity, which probably means that the malware creators simply lost interest in developing the ransomware and decided to concentrate on the banking one.Roughly the same thing happened to Pletor – the malware considered to be the first example of ransomware and allegedly created by the authors of the infamous Acecard banking Trojan. In 2014-2015 it secured a fairly visible share of the pie of mobile users attacked with ransomware, but by 2015-2016 it had disappeared from the top, leaving only three big ransomware families on the “market”.Fig. 15: The distribution of the share of attacked users between the most active mobile ransomware families in 2014-2015 (left) in comparison to the one in 2015-2016 (right).Another significant thing seen during the 24 months covered by the report was the competition between two big ransomware families: Small and Fusob. In 2014-2015, the Small family was the leader, at least in terms of the share of attacked users. It accounted for 69.11% of all users encountering mobile ransomware at least once. But a year later, the Fusob family had taken over the lead hitting 56.25% of users. The Small family, however, remained number two with 37.23% of attacked users. The Svpeng, Pletor, Small and Fusob malware are likely to be sold by their authors to other cybercriminals or propagated through affiliate networks – all four families have undergone a lot of modifications.

They are: getImage(), which takes a photo with the help of the device’s front camera, and inst() used to install a previously downloaded APK file.The criminals usually demand between $100 and $200 to unblock the device. The ransom has to be paid in the form of codes from pre-paid iTunes cards.Fig. 18.

This is because of the security features implemented recently into the Android OS, which limits the ability of third-party apps to get unlimited access to users’ files. Also, encryption is not as effective on mobile as it is on a PC, because the Android OS and popular Android apps often come with features that enable data to be backed-up automatically to the cloud, which is obviously not the case for PCs.In short, criminals targeting mobile devices don’t need to invest resources in the development of encryption malware, since the damage it can do is limited. The same cannot be said for classic blockers; these are much more efficient on a mobile device than on a PC. The difference is simple: if a PC user encounters blocker ransomware – even a sophisticated one – then in the worst case scenario they will be able to remove the hard drive from the infected PC, attach it to another PC and manually remove all malicious files. It is almost impossible to do the same with a mobile device as its hardware is impossible to remove easily and analyze with the help of an extraneous device.Perhaps this is the main reason why the mobile ransomware landscape is mostly a landscape of blockers.As mentioned before, crypto-ransomware has existed for years. Sporadic attempts to turn crypto-ransomware into a profitable business-model were spotted by Kaspersky Lab researchers as early as 2006 with the Gpcode ransomware family and the copycats that followed. The approach was standard: after a successful infection, the malicious program would show a ransom message and would demand money, usually a hundred dollars or so, sent through a bank transfer.Fig. 27: An example of a message left by criminals on a PC infected with Gpcode-like ransomware, from 2008But there was no big criminal-to-criminal industry behind those initial attempts to spread crypto-ransomware. Usually it was the work of a single criminal or a small group of criminals, and although in the period from 2006 to 2011, Gpcode or similar samples of crypto-ransomware appeared regularly on our radar, the intensity of attacks at that time cannot be compared with what we see today.Several years after the last waves of attacks with Gpcode and its followers, crypto-ransomware was chosen by big financial malware actors as a way of earning illegal income. Perhaps the brightest example of this trend was the infamous Gameover Zeus botnet. Originally created for stealing credentials in order to access online banking services, at some point the botnet creators started to use it to infect victims with Cryptolocker ransomware and demand a ransom. The damage done by this botnet was extensive, but luckily, in 2014, following an international effort led by Europol and the FBI, the botnet was shut down.Allegedly, the ransomware scheme was a sort of side business for the creators of the botnet – a way of monetizing those PCs in the botnet that had no access to online banking systems. A few other groups of criminals known for spreading financial malware have also been spotted undertaking crypto-ransomware activities. But at the end of the day, this model hasn’t become widespread and it is not what brought crypto-ransomware to the level of attacks that we see today.It is no secret that most of today’s crypto-ransomware has Russian roots, both in terms of the authors of the malicious code and of the actors who spread the malware and demand the ransom. The groups behind ransomware attacks are mainly small or medium-sized and they cooperate by means of a business scheme: affiliate networks.Small groups often consist of non-professional but very motivated members willing to invest money and time into any cybercriminal activity promising money. Middle-sized groups usually contain some professional programmers and web technology specialists. They are able to produce malware and to build and support the IT infrastructure that forms the technological backbone for the malware.Over the last few years, middle-sized groups have been able to create several “products” that, in the case of ransomware comprise a kind of DIY set that less-skilled criminals can buy, modify into their own unique version of the malware, and then use to make money. For this they would tune the set in order to make it work with certain C&C servers, encrypt files with certain keys etc. After that they would either try to spread the newly-created malware themselves (investing additional money into buying traffic, spam mailings or renting exploit-kits), or would urge other criminals – entry-level ones – to do this through affiliate programs.Through this business scheme, multiple affiliates receive a unique version of the malware from the owner of the affiliate network, and take charge of its distribution: spreading it through websites, spam and other ways of propagation. Every time a victim infected with such malware pays the ransom, the affiliate receives some cash from the owner of the network, who gets the lion’s share of the ransom.There is nothing new in the affiliate network business model being used by cybercriminals in order to ease the propagation of malware. In the past, this model has been used to propagate Blockers, SMS-Trojans and of course banking Trojans, along with thousands of different adware and pornware strings.Fig. 28: A description of the capabilities that the affiliate program would give a participant. Along with s strong encryption algorithm, this affiliate program offers its partners a user-friendly interface for a landing page in a Tor-network which would serve as a web-proxy for ransom transactionsThis business model appears to be more viable for ransomware than for any other type of malware. The main reason for this is the fact that victims of ransomware tend to pay for releasing their files and thereby pour money into the underground economy of cybercrime.First and foremost, because users pay.It seems that in recent years regular users and companies have reached the point where the information stored on their PC is valuable enough to consider paying a ransom on demand. The massive transition in organizations towards the use of digital documents and automated business processes for accounting and other day-to-day activities is helping to accelerate this. A company whose tax documentation, for example is encrypted with ransomware just before the deadline for submitting returns to the tax regulator, has no choice but to pay the ransom – and this is what criminals exploit. As a result, crypto-ransomware has become, almost uniquely, a type of malware that can cause tangible business damage by making critical operational files unreadable. This damage cannot not always be rolled back, so sometimes paying the ransom is the only way to retrieve the data.Another important factor which has positively affected the rise of ransomware is the appearance of new payment tools. New crypto-currencies, for example are now often accompanied by how-to-use guides “for dummies” that teach mainstream users how to use such currencies.In the past, cybercriminals tended to use either legitimate payment systems or semi-legitimate services in order to transfer money to each other and from their victims. The problem for criminals is that legitimate payment systems, reacting to the rise in fraudulent payments, have started to track and block suspicious transactions, making money transfer a far more risky business for cyber-crooks.With underground and semi-legal payment systems the problem is that no guarantees are given to the users of such systems (no refunds, no protection from other criminals) and the privacy of these transactions is also always questionable. At the end of the day the fate of each known underground payment system (from E-gold to Liberty Reserve) is always the same: sooner or later it goes down, due to a law enforcement investigation or some other reason.That is why money transaction for cybercriminals has always been an area of risk. But things changed significantly when the price of crypto-currencies – bitcoin in particular – rose and stabilized enough to allow a lot of users to convert real money. Criminals have started to exploit the advantages crypto-currencies over other type of e-currency: anonymity and a distributed nature, which both allow them to hide fraudulent transactions and make it impossible for a law enforcement agency to do anything, as the system has no center and no owner. These features help to support individual privacy rights but, unfortunately also give cybercriminals a very reliable and secret payment tool. The main outcome of this is that ransomware has become the new black in the underground.It has acquired a fairly viable criminal ecosystem where, powered by money from attacked users, specific niches for different types of criminals have emerged. Affiliate networks have become the main way for all of them to generate profit. And – what is more dangerous – they have opened doors to the criminal world for those who doesn’t have enough knowledge and expertise to develop their own ransomware. With multiple affiliate networks on the market, they need only basic skills in programming and web design.Another important reason for the rise in crypto-ransomware is the fact that law enforcement can find it difficult to respond. Most victims of cryptors are ordinary people who do not always report the attack to the police. This leaves law enforcement agencies and forensic experts with a very limited amount of evidence to work with: law enforcement representatives generally have too few reported cases to justify an investigation, and forensic specialists lack enough actual evidence to use against the actors behind crypto-ransomware. At Kaspersky Lab we are eager to change this situation and we are ready to help law enforcement agencies and other interested organizations with technical analyses of malware. The pressure of the law is a valuable tool in the fight against ransomware. This was proven by the case against the criminals who spread screen blocker malware in 2010. The arrests that took place in August 2010 in Russia showed other cyber-criminals that the consequences of their actions could be severe. The wave of screen blockers started to fade after those arrests and we believe that the same approach would work with crypto-ransomware criminals.Based on the statistics and trends described in this report, we were able to come to the following conclusions:Alongside these conclusions we believe that the current ransomware threat landscape provides a good basis for several predictions on how this threat will evolve in the future.Predictions:As legal action is one of the few way to actually disrupt the activity of groups behind crypto-ransomware, more arrests of ransomware dealers will take place. In 2015, Kaspersky Lab assisted the Dutch police in the investigation of the CoinVault ransomware attacks. The result of this investigation was the arrest of two suspects and the publication of decryption keys online.New arrests are a must for an effective fight against crypto-ransomware as they significantly increase the risks for criminals embarking on such malicious activity.While crypto-ransomware is one of the most dangerous types of malware ever created, and the consequences of it could be really severe, we at Kaspersky Lab believe that there are ways to protect yourself or your organization against this threat.Tips to consumers:Tips to businessesKaspersky Lab offers multi-layered protection against this widespread increasing threat. Kaspersky Lab’s solutions combat all known types of ransomware to secure user’s data. When these solutions are in place, most ransomware is “caught” when it is attempting to penetrate a device. Nonetheless, even if malware does manage to sneak through, there is another layer of protection – System Watcher technology – that is able to block and roll back malicious changes made on a device, such as the encryption of files or blocked access to the monitor.

"The company’s RV line of small-business routers contains 15 different security vulnerabilities, some unpatched, that could enable everything from RCE to corporate network access and denial-of-service – and many have exploits circulating. UPDATE Critical security vulnerabilities in Cisco’s Small Business RV Series routers could allow privilege escalation, remote code execution (RCE) with root privileges on the devices and more. The RV series is a set of affordable VPN appliances that enable remote workers to connect to a company network. They come with built-in firewalls, advanced encryption and authentication features. The critical bugs are part of 15 total vulnerabilities affecting the RV product line that Cisco disclosed this week. Some of the issues are exploitable on their own, while others must be chained together, the networking giant said – but they all could lead to a concerning cornucopia of bad outcomes. Some of these remain unpatched at the time of writing. According to Cisco’s Wednesday advisory, attackers could exploit the bugs (which variously affect the RV160, RV260, RV340 and RV345 appliances) to do the following: Execute arbitrary code Elevate privileges Execute arbitrary commands Bypass authentication and authorization protections Fetch and run unsigned software Cause denial of service (DoS) Cisco also said that proof-of-concept exploits are available for “several of the vulnerabilities,” but the company didn’t offer details on any in-the-wild attacks. Some of the flaws only affect the RV340/RF345 line of Dual WAN Gigabit VPN routers, noted where applicable below. These affect version 1.0.03.24 and earlier and are patched in version 1.0.03.26. For the RV160 and RV260 series, Cisco noted that versions 1.0.01.05 and earlier are affected. January’s release of firmware version 1.0.01.07 addressed some of the issues, as detailed in the release notes (PDF), but full patches are still forthcoming, the vendor confirmed to Threatpost. And unfortunately, in the meantime, no workarounds are available. “Cisco is working on fixes for the identified vulnerabilities for the RV160 and RV260 series routers as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson said. “Of the vulnerabilities identified in the advisory, five have fixes available today in release version 1.0.01.07. The remaining fixes will be released as soon as possible in February.” Source: Cisco security advisory. Source: Cisco Release Notes for RV160, firmware version 1.0.01.07. Critical Cisco Bugs in RV Routers Remote Code Execution The most concerning critical vulnerability rates 10 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale. It arises in the SSL VPN module of Cisco Small Business RV340, RV340W, RV345 and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN routers. It could allow unauthenticated RCE, according to the advisory. At worst, device takeover would allow unfettered access to the business network on the part of an attacker. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests,” the advisory reads. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to the affected device that is acting as an SSL VPN Gateway. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with root privileges on the affected device.” This one’s of note, researchers said, because it exists in a favorite cybercrime target. “With the increase in usage of SSL VPNs over the last three years since the beginning of the pandemic, SSL VPNs are a favored attack vector for cybercriminals, as they recognize that organizations need to ensure access to internal resources for remote employees,” Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, said via email. Privilege-Escalation Vulnerabilities The flaws tracked as CVE-2022-20700, CVE-2022-20701 and CVE-2022-20702 meanwhile exist in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers and could allow a remote attacker to elevate privileges to root. CVE-2022-20700 and CVE-2022-20701 both rate critical, with CVSS scores of 10 and 9, respectively, whileCVE-2022-20702 is rated medium-severity with a CVSS score of 6. “These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient authorization enforcement mechanisms,” according to the advisory. “An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by submitting specific commands to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root and execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.” Running Unsigned Software A critical bug tracked as CVE-2022-20703 (with a CVSS score of 9.3) is a vulnerability in the software image verification feature of the RV series that an unauthenticated, local adversary could exploit to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries. “This vulnerability is due to improper verification of software images as they are installed on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on the device,” the advisory reads. Critical Command-Injection Bugs Three bugs affecting the RV340, RV340W, RV345 and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system, Cisco warned. The first, CVE-2022-20707, is critical and carries a CVSS rating of 10. CVE-2022-20708 and CVE-2022-20749 are both high-severity, with CVSS ratings of 7.3. “These vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending malicious input to an affected device,” according to the advisory. Other Cisco Bugs in the RV Line Cisco also disclosed several high- and medium-severity vulnerabilities. High-Severity Command Injection A vulnerability in the Open Plug and Play (PnP) module (CVE-2022-20706, CVSS score of 8.3) of the appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system, Cisco said. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input,” Cisco explained. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to an affected device.” One caveat: A successful exploit requires the attacker to be in a man-in-the-middle (MitM) position or have control of a device connected to the vulnerable router. High-Severity Authentication-Bypass Bug A high-severity vulnerability in the session management of the web interface for the RV appliances (CVE-2022-20705, CVSS score of 5.3) could be exploited by an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take actions within the web UI with privileges up to the level of the administrative user and launch further attacks, exploiting the other vulnerabilities described in this advisory,” according to Cisco. “The attacker could obtain partial administrative privileges and perform unauthorized actions.” The bug is due to “weak entropy for session identifier generation functions,” which a cyberattacker could exploit by brute-forcing a current session identifier, then reusing it to take over an ongoing session. Alternatively, an adversary could craft a new, valid session identifier and bypass the authentication mechanism entirely. High-Severity Arbitrary File Overwrite Bug The bug tracked as CVE-2022-20711 (with a CVSS score of 8.2) is found in the web interface of the RV340, RV340W, RV345 and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN routers. It  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite certain files on an affected device. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for specific components of the web UI,” Cisco explained. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite existing files or exfiltrate confidential data by tampering with the files that are served by the web UI process.” High-Severity RCE A vulnerability in the upload module of the RV devices (CVE-2022-20712) could allow RCE as a non-root user. It rates 7.3 on the CVSS scale. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary checks when processing specific HTTP requests,” according to Cisco. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTP requests to an affected device.” Medium-Severity MitM Exploit for Server Communications The CVE-2022-20704 bug (medium-severity, with a CVSS score of 4.8) in the software-upgrade module of the RV series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view or alter information being shared between an affected device and specific Cisco servers (cloudsso.cisco.com and api.cisco.com). It’s due to improper validation of the SSL server certificate that is received when establishing the server connections, according to the advisory. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and the server, and then using a forged certificate to impersonate the server,” Cisco explained. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the affected device to download arbitrary software images and launch further attacks, combining other vulnerabilities.” Medium-Severity Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345 and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers (CVE-2022-20709, with a CVSS rating of 5.3) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to an affected device. “This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement mechanisms in the context of file uploads,” according to Cisco. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device.” Medium-Severity DoS Bug A vulnerability in the internal interprocess communication of the RV line (CVE-2022-20710, with a CVSS score of 5.3) could allow DoS attacks from an unauthenticated, remote attacker. The issue specifically affects the log-in functionality of the web-based management interface for the appliances, which “erroneously handled exceptions during failed login attempts,” according to Cisco. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP packet to an affected device,” the advisory reads. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent users from logging in to the affected device. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would not impact users who are already logged in.” This posting was updated on Feb. 4 at 1 p.m. ET to include a statement from Cisco confirming that some of the bugs are unpatched.

"Adobe released security updates for Reader, Acrobat and Flash Player. The Reader and Acrobat patches address a zero-day vulnerability being exploited in limited targeted attacks. Adobe today released an out-of-band patch for a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe Reader and Acrobat that has been leveraged in targeted attacks. Kaspersky Lab Global Research and Analysis Team director Costin Raiu is credited with reporting the vulnerability. Details were not announced, but Raiu said on the Securelist blog that exploits have been observed in a limited number of targeted attacks. Adobe said attackers have been targeting Windows machines running the Reader and Acrobat software. “At the moment, we are not providing any details on these attacks as the investigation is still ongoing,” Raiu said. “Although these attacks are very rare, just to stay on the safe side we recommend everyone to get the update from the Adobe site as soon as possible.” Adobe said today’s update patches a vulnerability (CVE-2014-0546) that when exploited allows an attacker to circumvent sandbox protections. Reader and Acrobat for Apple OS X are not vulnerable, Adobe said. Raiu called it “a rather creative sandbox escape.” Reader and Acrobat versions 11.0.07 and earlier for Windows are affected, Adobe said. The Reader update is one of two released today by Adobe. The other patches seven vulnerabilities in Flash Player, most of which are rated critical by Adobe. None of the Flash bugs are being exploited in the wild, Adobe said. Five of the updates patch memory-related vulnerabilities that can be used to bypass memory address randomization, Adobe said. The two remaining patches address a security bypass vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability that could allow a hacker to remotely execute code on the underlying system. Affected versions are: Adobe Flash Player 14.0.0.145 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.394 and earlier versions for Linux Adobe AIR 14.0.0.110 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 SDK and earlier versions Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 SDK & Compiler and earlier versions Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 and earlier versions for Android All of the Flash bugs are rated critical and can lead to code execution. : Hacks Vulnerabilities","T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1055 Process Injection","<s>[INST] Adobe released security updates for Reader, Acrobat and Flash Player.

Details were not announced, but Raiu said on the Securelist blog that exploits have been observed in a limited number of targeted attacks. Adobe said attackers have been targeting Windows machines running the Reader and Acrobat software. “At the moment, we are not providing any details on these attacks as the investigation is still ongoing,” Raiu said. “Although these attacks are very rare, just to stay on the safe side we recommend everyone to get the update from the Adobe site as soon as possible.” Adobe said today’s update patches a vulnerability (CVE-2014-0546) that when exploited allows an attacker to circumvent sandbox protections. Reader and Acrobat for Apple OS X are not vulnerable, Adobe said. Raiu called it “a rather creative sandbox escape.” Reader and Acrobat versions 11.0.07 and earlier for Windows are affected, Adobe said. The Reader update is one of two released today by Adobe. The other patches seven vulnerabilities in Flash Player, most of which are rated critical by Adobe. None of the Flash bugs are being exploited in the wild, Adobe said. Five of the updates patch memory-related vulnerabilities that can be used to bypass memory address randomization, Adobe said. The two remaining patches address a security bypass vulnerability and a use-after-free vulnerability that could allow a hacker to remotely execute code on the underlying system. Affected versions are: Adobe Flash Player 14.0.0.145 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh Adobe Flash Player 11.2.202.394 and earlier versions for Linux Adobe AIR 14.0.0.110 and earlier versions for Windows and Macintosh Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 SDK and earlier versions Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 SDK & Compiler and earlier versions Adobe AIR 14.0.0.137 and earlier versions for Android All of the Flash bugs are rated critical and can lead to code execution. : Hacks Vulnerabilities [/INST] T1497 Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,T1055 Process Injection </s>"
"A year-old proof-of-concept attack that allows an attacker to bypass TLS email protections to snoop on messages has been patched. Researchers warn hackers can snoop on email messages by exploiting a bug in the underlying technology used by the majority of email servers that run the Internet Message Access Protocol, commonly referred to as IMAP. The bug, first reported in August 2020 and patched Monday, is tied to the email server software Dovecot, used by over three-quarters of IMAP servers, according to Open Email Survey. The vulnerability opens the door to what is called a meddle-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, according to a report by researchers Fabian Ising and Damian Poddebniak, with M\u00fcnster University of Applied Sciences, based in Germany. \u201cThe vulnerability allows a MITM attacker between a mail client and Dovecot to inject unencrypted commands into the encrypted TLS context, redirecting user credentials and mails to the attacker,\u201d according to research linked to from a bug bounty page and dated August 2020. A patch for the vulnerability, rated by the vendor as -severity and by the third-party security firm Tenable as critical, is available for download in the form of Dovecot version v2.3.14.1. Bypassing TLS and Certificates The flaw centers around the implementation of the email instruction called START-TLS, a command issued between an email program and server that\u2019s designed to secure the delivery of email messages, according to a technical description by Anubisnetworks. \u201cWe found that Dovecot is affected by a command injection issue in START-TLS. This bug allows [an attacker] to bypass security features of SMTP such as the blocking of plaintext logins. Furthermore, it allows [an attacker] to mount a session fixation attack, which possibly results in stealing of credentials such as the SMTP username and password,\u201d researchers wrote. A session fixation attack allows an adversary to hijack a client-server connection after the user logs in, according to an OWASP description. \u201cIn order to conduct the attack, an attacker first creates a legit account on a Dovecot server. They now wait for and [intercept] an encrypted connection on port 465 from a victim\u2019s email client,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cAs soon as the client connects, the attacker initiates a separate START-TLS connection to Dovecot and injects their own malicious prefix, e.g. a login command.\u201d Researchers say, due to the implementation flaw with START-TLS in Dovecot, the attacker can login to the session and forward the full TSL traffic from the targeted victim\u2019s SMTP server as part of its own session. \u201cThe attacker obtains the full credentials from its own inbox. At no point was TLS broken or certificates compromised,\u201d the researchers wrote. The pair also outlined the bug in a proof-of-concept attack. Patches Available A fix for the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-33515, is available for Dovecot running on Ubuntu, the Linux distribution based on Debian. Dovecot version v2.3.14.1 and later mitigates the issue. Workaround fixes have been available for the flaw and are outlined by Ising and Poddebniak. One of them includes disabling START-TLS and configuring Dovecot to only accept \u201cpure TLS connections\u201d on port 993/465/995. \u201cNote that it is not sufficient to reconfigure a mail client to not use START-TLS. The attack must be mitigated on the server, as any TLS connection is equally affected,\u201d the researchers wrote.

"The streaming box allows arbitrary code execution as root, paving the way to pilfering social-media tokens, passwords, messaging history and more. A critical bug in the Hindotech HK1 TV Box would allow root-privilege escalation thanks to improper access control. A successful exploit would allow attackers to steal social-networking account tokens, Wi-Fi passwords, cookies, saved passwords, user-location data, message history, emails, contacts and more, researchers said. The bug, which is awaiting a CVE assignment, comes in at 9.3 out of 10 on the CvSS severity scale, according to researchers at Sick.Codes, a security resource for developers. The HK1 Box S905X3 TV Box is an Android-based streaming box that plugs into a TV and allows users to access YouTube, Netflix and other streaming content “over-the-top,” i.e., without a cable subscription. Users can also sign into their favorite email, music and social-networking-related apps for a full “smart TV” experience. It retails for under $100. Click to Register! The vulnerability would allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate to root, the Sick.Codes team said in a posting this week. At issue is a lack of authentication when it comes to the debugging functions of the set-top – specifically, when connected to the device through the serial port (UART), or while using the Android Debug Bridge (adb), as an unprivileged user. adb is a versatile command-line tool that lets users communicate with a device. It facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that can be used to run a variety of commands on a device. “A local attacker using adb, or a physical attacker connecting to the device through the UART serial debugging port, is dropped into a shell as the ‘shell’ user without entering a username or password,” researchers explained. “Once logged in as the ‘shell’ user, the attacker can escalate to root using the /sbin/su binary which is group executable (750), or /system/xbin/su which is executable by all users (755).” Once endowed with root privileges, the attacker can view any of the information for the apps the user is signed into – paving the way for stealing access tokens, passwords, contacts and messages and more. Attackers could also use the HK1 Box maliciously to sniff other devices on the same network, usually in a home-networking environment, according to the analysis. “For example, once root, the network Wi-Fi password can be read in plain text at /data/misc/wifi/WifiConfigStore.xml,” researchers explained. Thus far, the issue has not been addressed. The vendor for the device is the Shenzhen Hindo Technology Co.,Ltd., based just outside of Hong Kong. The researchers were unable to contact the company (and its website, www.hindotech.com, was down as of the time of writing). Instead, the researchers submitted a draft advisory to Amlogic, which shares branding with the device in the States – and received no response.

"Macro-based attacks are a dime a dozen, but a new Hancitor variant illustrates how cybercriminals are upping their game when it comes building more sophisticated malicious attachments. Researchers said a new variant of the Hancitor downloader has shifted tactics and adopted new dropper strategies and obfuscation techniques on infected PCs. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks are currently tracking the biggest push of the Hancitor family of malware since June that it says has shifted away from H1N1 downloader and now distributes the Pony and Vawtrak executables. The variant uses native API calls within Visual Basic code to carve out and decrypt embedded malware from malicious Word documents. “Lures were expected, until we started digging into the actual documents attached and saw an interesting method within the Visual Basic macros in the attached documents used for dropping the malware,” wrote Jeff White, senior threat researcher at Palo Alto Networks, in a report. White said that there is nothing remarkable about the MS Office OLE2 Word Document that uses a standard ploy pushing recipients to “enable content” and run the malicious macro. Rather, what interested researchers was the technique used to drop the malware along with the relationship it discovered between Hancitor’s VB macros and embedded shellcode. “This was the first time we’ve seen (this dropping technique) used in this way,” White said. Ryan Olson, researcher at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 team, explains that droppers typically use Office documents that either download an executable or have an executable inside of it. In this case Hancitor embeds the executable into the VBA and decodes and executes the function on its own. “When you have embedded code inside an Office document you open up more risk of being detected by an antivirus program,” said Olson in an interview with Threatpost. “With Hancitor the code is embedded in the VB that encrypts it in a way that the AV isn’t going to find it. In this case they are using CallWindowProcA instead of ShellExecute or CreateProcess which an AV program will likely see.” Noteworthy is the fact the macro contains logic that can determine host system’s architecture and whether the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit. “What is really interesting is that the authors went through the trouble to actually write their own base64 decoder purely in VB,” White said. In a complex chain of events centering around API calls tied VirtualAlloc, RtlMoveMemory, and CallWindowProcA, the VB macro runs through several stages. “The macro base64 decodes the payload into a local byte-array and then we come to our first API call, VirtualAlloc… Afterwards, the VB macro continues to setup the next call to RtlMoveMemory and then calls it with the location of the memory from the previous call and our base64 decoded byte array,” White said. After code has been copied to the executable WINWORD.EXE process memory, the macro sets up the last API call for CallWindowProcA. These actions redirect code execution to shellcode, White said. From here, the shellcode is directed to load shellcode values and seek out the malware binary. The binary is encrypted and only decrypted after a number of sub-routines are executed. Next, it places the binary in the temp directory, which then ends up writing itself to ‘%SYSTEMROOT%/system32/WinHost.exe’. At this point, the malicious Hancitor downloader has been fully loaded on the victim’s machine, according to White. “From the encoded shellcode within the macro and using native API calls within VB code to pass execution to carving out and decrypting the embedded malware from the Word document, it’s a new use of Hancitor that we’ll be following closely,” White notes. : Hacks Malware Vulnerabilities","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1055 Process Injection,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] Macro-based attacks are a dime a dozen, but a new Hancitor variant illustrates how cybercriminals are upping their game when it comes building more sophisticated malicious attachments.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes In today’s business environment, the term “endpoint” has become synonymous with any device that can connect to a network – desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones and most recently, IoT devices. As endpoints continue to evolve, so do threats. Unfortunately, today’s firewalls and antivirus software can no longer protect an organization’s evolving environment. Endpoints are now exposed to a plethora of malicious activity including ransomware, phishing, malvertising, drive-by-downloads, cyrptojacking, software subversion and other backchannel attacks. Not to mention, attackers are leveraging zero-day attacks, where previously undetected vulnerabilities are used to deliver malicious payloads into endpoints. So how do today’s businesses protect against these malicious threats? First, companies need to gain a deeper understanding of “endpoint” before selecting the “right” endpoint protection platform (EPP). Unknown Files Driving Change According to recent research from Comodo Cybersecurity, unknown files – an unrecognizable executable that is potentially malicious – have skyrocketed in the last five years, with more than 300,000 new malicious files detected every day. Dealing with new or unknown files is one of the most critical capabilities to any EPP. Most EPP products use assumptive based trust, known as a Default Allow posture, when dealing with new or unknown files. This method allows files, other than known bad files, to have unfettered write privilege to system files, which assumes that files not identified as bad must be good or safe. As you can imagine, one of the major problems with a Default Allow security posture is that cybercriminals are constantly building new variants to avoid detection from these endpoint security solutions. This can leave companies exposed to threats for days, weeks, even months before detected. Beyond the Sandbox Many EPP vendors have integrated sandbox technology into their products to combat malicious software and have had success in combatting cybercriminals. For those unfamiliar, a sandbox is an isolated virtualized environment that mimics an endpoint operation environment to safely execute unknown files, without risking harm to the host device or network. However, this once valuable solution is starting to lose its effectiveness. Cybercriminals are creating threats that can detect when a sandbox is being used and automatically take steps to avoid detection. In addition, sandboxes are becoming more resource intensive and more complex, slowing down their ability to process threats without hindering productivity. The Need for a Zero Trust Architecture As cybercriminals are using the Default Allow approach to their benefit, while also modifying these variants to bypass sandboxes, companies need a better solution. The obvious answer is to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, where unknown executables are never trusted and always verified, without impacting user productivity. To successfully achieve a Zero Trust architecture, 100% of unknown files must be instantly contained and analyzed in the cloud and by humans to prevent breaches.  Additionally, the business still needs to operate, and users should not have to experience productivity loss or impact.  Successfully achieving a Zero Trust architecture will bulletproof your business from damage.  Best Practices for Evaluating EPP Protecting endpoints from malicious software, intrusions and cyberattacks is one of the most crucial aspects of securing an organization’s IT resources. Endpoint protection must be part of a holistic IT security approach where network perimeter security solutions secure the boundaries between internal networks and a service provider’s network, and endpoint protection further reduces the risk of threats or malicious activity impacting IT operations. The first step in choosing an EEP solution is evaluating the needs of the business, which should include capacity and scalability, compliance, budget and policies. The next step is to closely examine the capabilities, which should include, but is not limited to centralized management, threat detection and blocking, unknown file handling, file reputation scoring and verdicting and support to achieve a Zero Trust architecture. Selecting the Right EPP by Running an Effective Proof of Concept In addition to these best practices, Gartner recently released a research paper in which they strongly recommend that security and risk management leaders run a thorough proof of concept (POC) to accurately determine which endpoint protection platform is the most suitable. Conclusion Protecting organizations from today’s ever evolving threat vectors requires EPP solutions that provide more than detection technology and whitelists to identify good and bad files. EPP products must evolve into a platform approach, where multiple cybersecurity technologies, capabilities and techniques are integrated into an advanced automated umbrella of protection, which stops both known and unknown threats to prevent breaches.

So how do today’s businesses protect against these malicious threats? First, companies need to gain a deeper understanding of “endpoint” before selecting the “right” endpoint protection platform (EPP). Unknown Files Driving Change According to recent research from Comodo Cybersecurity, unknown files – an unrecognizable executable that is potentially malicious – have skyrocketed in the last five years, with more than 300,000 new malicious files detected every day. Dealing with new or unknown files is one of the most critical capabilities to any EPP. Most EPP products use assumptive based trust, known as a Default Allow posture, when dealing with new or unknown files. This method allows files, other than known bad files, to have unfettered write privilege to system files, which assumes that files not identified as bad must be good or safe. As you can imagine, one of the major problems with a Default Allow security posture is that cybercriminals are constantly building new variants to avoid detection from these endpoint security solutions. This can leave companies exposed to threats for days, weeks, even months before detected. Beyond the Sandbox Many EPP vendors have integrated sandbox technology into their products to combat malicious software and have had success in combatting cybercriminals. For those unfamiliar, a sandbox is an isolated virtualized environment that mimics an endpoint operation environment to safely execute unknown files, without risking harm to the host device or network. However, this once valuable solution is starting to lose its effectiveness. Cybercriminals are creating threats that can detect when a sandbox is being used and automatically take steps to avoid detection. In addition, sandboxes are becoming more resource intensive and more complex, slowing down their ability to process threats without hindering productivity. The Need for a Zero Trust Architecture As cybercriminals are using the Default Allow approach to their benefit, while also modifying these variants to bypass sandboxes, companies need a better solution. The obvious answer is to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, where unknown executables are never trusted and always verified, without impacting user productivity. To successfully achieve a Zero Trust architecture, 100% of unknown files must be instantly contained and analyzed in the cloud and by humans to prevent breaches.  Additionally, the business still needs to operate, and users should not have to experience productivity loss or impact.  Successfully achieving a Zero Trust architecture will bulletproof your business from damage.  Best Practices for Evaluating EPP Protecting endpoints from malicious software, intrusions and cyberattacks is one of the most crucial aspects of securing an organization’s IT resources. Endpoint protection must be part of a holistic IT security approach where network perimeter security solutions secure the boundaries between internal networks and a service provider’s network, and endpoint protection further reduces the risk of threats or malicious activity impacting IT operations. The first step in choosing an EEP solution is evaluating the needs of the business, which should include capacity and scalability, compliance, budget and policies. The next step is to closely examine the capabilities, which should include, but is not limited to centralized management, threat detection and blocking, unknown file handling, file reputation scoring and verdicting and support to achieve a Zero Trust architecture. Selecting the Right EPP by Running an Effective Proof of Concept In addition to these best practices, Gartner recently released a research paper in which they strongly recommend that security and risk management leaders run a thorough proof of concept (POC) to accurately determine which endpoint protection platform is the most suitable. Conclusion Protecting organizations from today’s ever evolving threat vectors requires EPP solutions that provide more than detection technology and whitelists to identify good and bad files. EPP products must evolve into a platform approach, where multiple cybersecurity technologies, capabilities and techniques are integrated into an advanced automated umbrella of protection, which stops both known and unknown threats to prevent breaches.

"One of the most serious issues is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows DNS, which could allow an attacker to take full control of the targeted machine. Microsoft has fixed 11 critical bugs in its June Patch Tuesday update, including a Windows DNS-related remote code execution flaw. It also patched an easily exploitable problem in the Cortana voice engine. One of the most serious issues is a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-8225) in the Windows Domain Name System (DNS), which could allow an attacker to take full control of the targeted machine. This can be carried out by sending a maliciously crafted DNS packet to the victim endpoint from a DNS server, or using spoofed DNS responses from an attack box, according to Microsoft’s June Patch Tuesday security bulletin. “The attacker could attempt to man-in-the-middle a legitimate query,” explained Dustin Childs, researcher at the Zero Day Initiative, in its Patch Tuesday analysis posted on Tuesday. “The more likely scenario is simply tricking a target DNS server into querying an evil server that sends the corrupted response – something that can be done from the command line. It’s also something that could be easily scripted. This means there’s a system-level bug in a listening service on critical infrastructure servers, which also means this is wormable.” He added, “‘patch now’ doesn’t even seem forceful enough. I have the sense we’ll be hearing about this bug for a while.” A privilege-escalation vulnerability rated important in Cortana (CVE-2018-8140) meanwhile is due to the voice engine’s service retrieving data from input services “without consideration for status,” according to Microsoft. It was first discussed in March at a researcher conference. “While that description from Microsoft is a bit oblique, it seems someone close enough to speak to a Cortana-enabled system could execute programs with elevated privileges,” said Childs. “Again, the attacker needs physical or console access to the system, so remote attacks not likely – provided you’re not talking on a speakerphone. Jokes aside, with the proliferation of personal assistants and similar services, bugs in these products will likely become more prevalent in the years to come.” Researchers put a finer point on it with a few proof-of-concepts for the Cortana flaw, demonstrating a range of attack vectors for accessing confidential information. For instance, after bypassing the locked screen using a simple voice command, McAfee found that it was possible to easily search for confidential information and files using Cortana to search for keywords such as “OneDrive”; and, the researchers were able to execute arbitrary code from the lock screen using Cortana’s contextual menu. In a demo, they were able to carry out a full password reset and then log in on a Windows 10 build. “This particular vulnerability is not highly critical, but it is interesting as it targets a growing and popular class of technology: intelligent digital personal assistants,” Lane Thames, senior security researcher at Tripwire, told Threatpost. “We’ve already seen weaknesses recently in Alexa due to third-party application issues. More of these types of problems will start to appear, most likely, in the years to come.” In total, Microsoft’s June Patch Tuesday roundup included 50 security patches, with 11 listed as critical and 39 rated important. An out-of-band fix meanwhile was released for Adobe Flash Player last week. Among the other notable patches is one for a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Edge’s Chakra scripting engine (CVE-2018-8229); this can be triggered when a victim visits a malicious website, where an attacker could use a specially crafted JavaScript program to execute arbitrary code. an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights, Microsoft said. “Because JavaScript is so pervasive and needed for many websites to even operate, disabling the Chakra Scripting Engine is not an option, which means the vast majority of Microsoft Edge users are vulnerable to this attack,” said Allan Liska, threat intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, via email. “It is important to patch Microsoft Edge as soon as possible to prevent this attack.” There’s also a critical HTTP Protocol Stack remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-8231) affecting the web server component http.sys, which confers elevated privileges to a remote attacker. The attacker can cause code execution by sending a malformed packet to a target server. “The patch notes that, ‘in most situations, an unauthenticated attacker’ could do this,” ZDI’s Childs said. “It’s unclear what those other situations may be, but that puts this bug pretty close to the wormable category as well. Either way, this should also be near the top of your test and patch priority list.” Other vulnerabilities being addressed include a remote code execution flaw in Excel (CVE-2018-8248); two privilege-escalation vulnerabilities in SharePoint Server and one in Office Web Apps Server; and seven separate Device Guard vulnerabilities in Windows 10 Enterprise and Server 2016 which allowed code integrity policies to be bypassed. “June’s Patch Tuesday is rather run-of-the-mill, with a total of 50 vulnerabilities being addressed by Microsoft,” said Greg Wiseman, senior security researcher at Rapid7, in an email. “None of the Microsoft vulnerabilities patched today have been seen in the wild, although CVE-2018-8267 (an RCE vulnerability in Internet Explorer) had been publicly disclosed before today’s release and is likely to be exploited soon if it hasn’t already been.” : Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services","<s>[INST] One of the most serious issues is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows DNS, which could allow an attacker to take full control of the targeted machine.

"Fixes are now available for five critical and high-severity Trend Micro flaws, two of which are being actively targeted by attackers. Trend Micro has released security updates patching five vulnerabilities in its endpoint security solutions, Apex One and OfficeScan XG for Windows. Specifically, Apex One 2019 and OfficeScan XG SP1 and XG are affected by four critical-severity (and one high-severity) flaws. Two of these vulnerabilities are under active attack. “Trend Micro has observed active attempts of potential attacks against … these vulnerabilities in the wild,” the company said in its Monday alert. “Customers are strongly encouraged to update to the latest versions as soon as possible.” The first of two flaws under attack is a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-8467) that exists in the migration tool component of Apex One and OfficeScan. The flaw could allow remote code execution on affected installations. While attackers could be remote, an attempted attack for this flaw requires authentication. The second flaw actively targeted is a high-severity bug (CVE-2020-8468) in Apex One and OfficeScan. According to the advisory, impacted are the software’s agents that are “affected by a content validation escape vulnerability which could allow an attacker to manipulate certain agent client components. An attempted attack requires user authentication.” Critical Flaws The advisory also pointed to three additional critical flaws. While attempted exploits in the wild have not been observed at this time for these flaws, they all rank 10 (out of 10) on the CVSS scale, indicating the highest level of severity. The first (CVE-2020-8470) stems from the Apex One and OfficeScan server containing a vulnerable service DLL file, which could enable an unauthenticated attacker to delete any file on the server with SYSTEM level privileges. Another (CVE-2020-8599) exists due to the server containing a vulnerable EXE file, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to write arbitrary data to an arbitrary path on affected installations and bypass ROOT login. And the final flaw (CVE-2020-8598) is due to the server containing a vulnerable service DLL file that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations with SYSTEM level privileges. The advisory stressed that exploiting these vulnerabilities generally requires that an attacker has access (physical or remote) to a vulnerable machine. So beyond updating to the latest fixed versions (which are listed below), users “are encouraged to review and ensure the product servers and management consoles are restricted to trusted networks and/or users as appropriate.” Trend Micro discovered all vulnerabilities in question. Researchers with Tenable noted in an analysis posted Tuesday, this isn’t the first time attackers have singled out Trend Micro. “In October 2019, Trend Micro published a security bulletin for CVE-2019-18187, a directory traversal vulnerability in OfficeScan. According to their bulletin, they had observed active attempts to exploit the flaw in the wild,” they said. “Customers running these products should be aware that attackers will continue to exploit these vulnerabilities and search for other, undiscovered vulnerabilities in these products.” Interested in security for the Internet of Things and how 5G will change things?

"A month has passed since the end of August, when we presented an unusual online scanner Top Twenty. Since then, the malware landscape has returned to a more normal state of affairs.The places occupied by worms last month have been taken over by malware which is traditionally present in the online scanner ratings: Trojan-Downloader and Trojan-Dropper programs.This month’s new leader is Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Delf.awg, which appeared on 6th September, when thousands of mail.ru users received a strange email from an unknown girl who offered to share her summer photographs and tales of her holiday. In spite of the fact that none of the recipients knew the Masha/ Liza/ Lena who was the alleged sender, they still opened the message and clicked on the attachment in the hope of seeing something nice. Tried and tested social engineering, which worked as well as it always does, and which helped caused one of the biggest outbreaks of Trojan-Spy LdPinch that we’ve seen over the past few months. LdPinch was the program which Delf.awg installed on the machines of unsuspecting or careless users.Out of all the unexpected data produced by August, only Backdoor.IRC.Zapchast managed to stand its ground, even rising to second position. This, together with Backdoor.Win32.mIRC-based (a Trojanized mIRC client) in 20th place and Backdoor.Win32.Rbot.gen in 18th place, shows that virus writers are exhibiting renewed interest in creating botnets which can be controlled via IRC.The Rays and Brontok worms, which were pushed down the table by other malicious programs in August, have returned to the top five. Interestingly, in spite of the fact that these worms do have the ability to spread via email, they mainly propagate by copying themselves to all network resources accessible on the victim machine. The numerous questions asked about Rays and Brontok infections on the Kaspersky Lab forum shows that this approach is a successful method.Parite.b, the classic file virus, isn’t lagging behind either. It’s been in existence for several years, and inevitably features in the reports of nearly all major antivirus companies. Parite.b is undoubtedly the leader among classic viruses, whereas it would be impossible to find an analogous leader among worms or Trojans. Another, similar virus, Hidrag.a, has also returned to the Top Twenty, making us think seriously that reports of the death of classic viruses are greatly exaggerated. File viruses aren’t able to spread as fast as worms, but once they have infected a system, they will instantly infect all executable files, rooting themselves deeply within the system. Consequently, in order to get rid of them, the user has to scan not just once, but systematically and repeatedly; after all, it may not just be your machine that’s infected, but neighbouring machines on the local network, which could then reinfect your system.Speaking of surprises, the number of email worms, and the total absence of Trojan-Spy programs in September’s ratings was unexpected. Banker.ark, which has intermittently been among the leaders throughout the past six months, and which was in 14th place in August, has not, as we predicted, returned to a leading position this month, but has instead dropped off the bottom of the table. Worms, on the other hand, have appeared in large numbers: in addition to Rays and Brontok (mentioned above), in September users were also attacked by Scano.ag, Warezov.aj and .at, and an old acquaintance, Bagle.fj. We think that Warezov will probably disappear from the rankings in October, but Bagle and Scano seem likely to remain a fixture for some time to come.Summary","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer","<s>[INST] A month has passed since the end of August, when we presented an unusual online scanner Top Twenty.

Interestingly, in spite of the fact that these worms do have the ability to spread via email, they mainly propagate by copying themselves to all network resources accessible on the victim machine. The numerous questions asked about Rays and Brontok infections on the Kaspersky Lab forum shows that this approach is a successful method.Parite.b, the classic file virus, isn’t lagging behind either. It’s been in existence for several years, and inevitably features in the reports of nearly all major antivirus companies. Parite.b is undoubtedly the leader among classic viruses, whereas it would be impossible to find an analogous leader among worms or Trojans. Another, similar virus, Hidrag.a, has also returned to the Top Twenty, making us think seriously that reports of the death of classic viruses are greatly exaggerated. File viruses aren’t able to spread as fast as worms, but once they have infected a system, they will instantly infect all executable files, rooting themselves deeply within the system. Consequently, in order to get rid of them, the user has to scan not just once, but systematically and repeatedly; after all, it may not just be your machine that’s infected, but neighbouring machines on the local network, which could then reinfect your system.Speaking of surprises, the number of email worms, and the total absence of Trojan-Spy programs in September’s ratings was unexpected. Banker.ark, which has intermittently been among the leaders throughout the past six months, and which was in 14th place in August, has not, as we predicted, returned to a leading position this month, but has instead dropped off the bottom of the table. Worms, on the other hand, have appeared in large numbers: in addition to Rays and Brontok (mentioned above), in September users were also attacked by Scano.ag, Warezov.aj and .at, and an old acquaintance, Bagle.fj. We think that Warezov will probably disappear from the rankings in October, but Bagle and Scano seem likely to remain a fixture for some time to come.Summary [/INST] T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer </s>"
"Reading Time: 4 minutes While other security companies and their users are still struggling to deal with the infamous ransomware Cryptolocker, we have no worries at Comodo.  In fact, if you use our Comodo Endpoint Security, with our unique Auto-Sandbox technology, you are already safe and secure from Cryptolocker 2.0 (officially entitled Prison Locker or Power Locker) and other soon-to-go-wild copycats roaming the Internet. How can we be so sure?  Because with over 70 million total installations of Comodo Antivirus there has not been a single reported incident of Cryptolocker on a Comodo protected computer. In fact, we provide a $5,000 virus free warranty to protect users of Comodo Endpoint Security and have not paid a single claim in over 6 years!  That is why we call our protection “ironclad”. We’ll explain why, but first let’s review.  What is Cryptolocker? Cryptolocker is a Trojan virus known as ransomware, spread predominantly through emails to infect Windows computers and extort money from its victims. Some analysts have called it the perfect criminal virus, almost impossible to defeat. We beg to differ, but we digress.  After being installed on your computer CryptoLocker takes control and locks up your data files, including all MS Office files. It then displays a message demanding you pay a ransom to unlock your files, around $300 in bitcoins or MoneyPak .  CryptoLocker itself can be removed by many anti-virus programs. Unfortunately your files will remain locked using encryption that is virtually impossible to break.  Pay up or you’re out of luck! Last December, Dell SecureWorks published an estimate that the original version of the program had infected around 200,000-300,000 PCs in 100 days.  Approximately 0.4 percent of these victims probably paid the demanded ransom. That may seem like a small percentage, but it would be haul of up to $360,000 for the hackers in just 3 months. With that kind of loot in play it is not surprising to see copycats appear, and they have. Of particular concern is an identified copycat we’ll euphemistically call CryptoLocker 2.0, aka Prison Locker.  It differs most significantly from the original CryptoLocker in that it encrypts more file formats and spreads through USB drives instead of email.  It reportedly opens up a new locked up Window and disables Windows and Escape Key.  It prevents you from running taskmgr.exe, regedit.exe, cmd.exe, explorer.exe, msconfig.exe while disabling the ALT+TAB key feature. The following is a side by side comparison. CryptoLocker vs. CryptoLocker 2.0 (Copycat)   CryptoLocker CryptoLocker 2.0 (PrisonLocker) Form of Encryption RSA-2048 RSA-1024 (weaker) Ransom Payment Options Bitcoin plus other forms of payment are accepted pay via Bitcoin only Code Microsoft’s Visual C++ C# programming language File Types Likely to be Stolen Business Files Business, Images, Video, and Audio Files Spreads Via… Drive-by-Downloads, Phishing Emails USB So, CryptLocker 2.0 or similar will soon be here and more copycats are sure to follow.  Why aren’t users of Comodo Endpoint Security concerned? Because thanks to Comodo’s Default/Deny strategy with Auto Sandboxing, these malicious programs will never have the opportunity lockup their files. Comodo Endpoint Security focuses on prevention, not purely detection. Comodo’s patent-pending Auto Sandboxing technology creates a real time, isolated environment that identifies safe, unsafe, and questionable files and executables and automatically isolates both unsafe and unknown files, allowing only known, trusted files to penetrate your system. If a threat is known to be malicious, Comodo’s Antivirus (AV) will detect its signature and prevent any damage from occurring, i.e. the encryption of your files. If the threat is unknown, the HIPS and Auto-Sandbox will intercept the malware, stopping it in its tracks, as the virus is never actually installed on your system. Comodo AV labs detect blacklist signatures for malicious files such as CryptoLocker, so the ransomware would go straight into the Quarantine or Sandbox Management consoles of Comodo Endpoint Security Manager (CESM) where the admin could delete it. CESM 3 packages unsurpassed protective power within our next-generation remote administrative console. This enables the administrator to receive real-time alerts through list or panoramic views of all endpoints and system management capabilities, a feature generally found only in dedicated RMM systems. So, when the user opens the malicious message containing CryptoLocker, CES will detect the malicious (or unknown) file, automatically sandbox it, and alert the administrator. If the admin gets to the alert before Comodo labs, the administrator is able to remotely remove the ransomware from the end user’s computer, regardless of the end user’s location.  Four clicks to security:  Administrator views the list of files within the sandbox. Administrator selects the malicious executable(s) to be removed. Administrator remotely accesses the end user’s computer to select the malicious file running on the sandbox. Administrator deletes the file location to rid the user’s system of the malicious application. Four clicks to security. It’s really that simple! But don’t just take our word for it. Comodo Endpoint Security (CES) is powered by the same patent-pending prevention-based technology that our consumer product, Comodo Internet Security (CIS), uses to protect consumers against CryptoLocker. CIS was recently awarded the top position in the Proactive Security Challenge 64 by matousec.com, a project run by a respected group of independent security experts dedicated to improving end user security. Following the challenge, matousec.com named CIS the “Ultimate Protection Machine.” In addition to its ability to protect enterprises from malware like CryptoLocker, ESM has many other great capabilities. For instance, the latest upgrade to ESM added several capabilities such as centralized monitoring of sandboxed (unknown) and malicious files, endpoint auto-synchronization via Active Directory, encrypted VNC sessions to local and remote endpoints, and support for Windows 7 Embedded Standard.

"Industrial enterprises in Europe are target of campaign, which forced a shutdown of industrial processes in at least one of its victims\u2019 networks, according to researchers. Threat actors are exploiting a Fortinet vulnerability flagged by the feds last week that delivers a new ransomware strain, dubbed Cring, that is targeting industrial enterprises across Europe. Researchers say the attackers are exploiting an unpatched path-reversal flaw, tracked as CVE-2018-13379, in Fortinet\u2019s FortiOS. The goal is to gain access to victims enterprise networks and ultimately deliver ransomware, according to a report by Kaspersky researchers published this week. \u201cIn at least in one case, an attack of the ransomware resulted in a temporary shutdown of the industrial process due to servers used to control the industrial process becoming encrypted,\u201d Kaspersky senior security researcher Vyacheslav Kopeytsev wrote in the report. Cring is relatively new to the ransomware threat landscape\u2014which already includes dominant strains REvil, Ryuk, Maze and Conti. Cring was first observed and reported by the researcher who goes by Amigo_A and Swisscom\u2019s CSIRT team in January. The ransomware is unique in that it uses two forms of encryption and destroys backup files in an effort to antagonize victims and prevent them from retrieving backup files without paying the ransom. Last week, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) groups were actively exploiting known security vulnerabilities in the Fortinet FortiOS operating system, affecting the company\u2019s SSL VPN products. One of those bugs, is CVE-2018-13379, a path-traversal flaw in Fortinet FortiOS. The vulnerability is tied to system\u2019s SSL VPN web portal and allows an unauthenticated attacker to download system files of targeted systems via a specially crafted HTTP resource requests. In its report Kaspersky echoed the feds\u2019 warning adding attackers are first scanning connections to Fortinet VPNs to see if the software used on the device is the vulnerable version. In the campaign researchers observed, threat actors follow an exploit chain, exploiting CVE-2018-13379 to launch a directory-traversal attack. The goal is to crack open affected hardware, give adversaries access to network credentials and to establish foothold in the targeted network, Kopeytsev explained. \u201cA directory-traversal attack allows an attacker to access system files on the Fortigate SSL VPN appliance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSpecifically, an unauthenticated attacker can connect to the appliance through the internet and remotely access the file \u2018sslvpn_websession,\u2019 which contains the username and password stored in cleartext.\u201d For it\u2019s part, \u201cthe security of our customers is our first priority,\u201d according to a statement from Fortinet provided to Threatpost. \u201cFor example, CVE-2018-13379 is an old vulnerability resolved in May 2019. Fortinet immediately issued a PSIRT advisory and communicated directly with customers and via corporate blog posts on multiple occasions in August 2019 and July 2020 strongly recommending an upgrade. Upon resolution we have consistently communicated with customers as recently as late as 2020. If customers have not done so, we urge them to immediately implement the upgrade and mitigations.\u201d Anatomy of an Attack Once gaining access to the first system on the enterprise network, attackers use the Mimikatz utility to steal the account credentials of Windows users who had previously logged in to the compromised system, according to Kaspersky. In this way, attackers compromised the domain administrator account, and then used commodity tools like Cobalt Stroke backdoor and Powershell to propagate attacks across various systems on the network, according to the report. After gaining complete control, attackers download a cmd script to launch Cring ransomware, naming the malicious execution script \u201cKaspersky\u201d to disguise it as a security solution, Kopeytsev said. The report breaks down how Cring achieves encryption and destroys existing backup files once it\u2019s launched on a system. First, the ransomware stops various services of two key programs on the network\u2014Veritas NetBackup and Microsoft SQL server. Cring also halts the SstpSvc service, which is used to create VPN connections, which researchers surmised was to block any remediation effort by system administrators, Kopeytsev said. \u201cIt is most likely that the attackers, who at this stage controlled the infected system via Cobalt Strike, did this to make it impossible to connect to the infected system remotely via VPN,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis was done to prevent system administrators from providing a timely response to the information security incident.\u201d Cring proceeds by terminating other application processes in Microsoft Office and Oracle Database software to facilitate encryption as well as the removal of key backup files to prevent recovery of files, according to the report. In its final step, Cring starts to encrypt files using strong encryption algorithms so victims can\u2019t decrypt files without knowing the RSA private key held by the attackers, Kopeytsev explained. First each file is encrypted using an AES encryption key and then that key is in turn encrypted using a 8,192-bit RSA public key hard-coded into the malicious program\u2019s executable file, he wrote. Once encryption is complete, the malware drops a ransom note from attackers asking for two bitcoins (currently the equivalent of about $114,000) in exchange for the encryption key. Learning from Mistakes The report points out key mistakes made by network administrators in the attack observed by Kaspersky researchers in the hopes that other organizations can learn from them. First the attack highlights once again the importance of keeping systems updated with the latest patches, which could have avoided the incident altogether, Kopeytsev said. \u201cThe primary causes of the incident include the use of an outdated and vulnerable firmware version on the Fortigate VPN server (version 6.0.2 was used at the time of the attack), which enabled the attackers to exploit the CVE-2018-13379 vulnerability and gain access to the enterprise network,\u201d he wrote. System administrators also left themselves open to attack by not only running an antivirus (AV) system that was outdated, but also by disabling some components of AV that further reduced the level of protection, according to the report. Key errors in configuring privileges for domain policies and the parameteres of RDP access also came into play in the attack, basically giving attackers free rein once they entered the network, Kopeytsev observed. \u201cThere were no restrictions on access to different systems,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn other words, all users were allowed to access all systems. Such settings help attackers to distribute malware on the enterprise network much more quickly, since successfully compromising just one user account provides them with access to numerous systems.\u201d Ever wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums? Find out on April 21 at 2 p.m. ET during a FREE Threatpost event, \u201cUnderground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy.\u201d Experts will take you on a guided tour of the Dark Web, including what\u2019s for sale, how much it costs, how hackers work together and the latest tools available for hackers.

"Reading Time: 3 minutes A single cyber-attack can cost you your business. Data from the National Cyber Security Alliance shows that 60 percent of small and mid-sized business close after 6 months following an attack. Businesses which fall prey to hackers and cybercriminals lose their customers’ trust and their clients’ repeat business. This is why investing in the services of a firm that handles cyber security for business is a must-have investment. Let’s take a closer look at why you should partner with a cyber security provider today: Cyber Security for Business Advantage 1: Protect Your Business from Cyber Attacks A cyber security provider’s main task is to protect your business from all forms of cyber-attacks. They will deploy security solutions like Comodo Endpoint Protection system to keep malware and hackers at bay. Their services revolve around actively updating your defenses and monitoring network activity to meet that end. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 2: Identify Weaknesses in Your Network Infrastructure Your network potentially harbors security vulnerabilities which will allow attackers entry into your system. When you hire a cyber security firm, one of the first things they’ll do is to audit every nook and cranny of your network for weaknesses. They’ll then report their findings to you and develop an action plan to plug these security holes and strengthen your network. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 3: Provide Cybersecurity Training If left untrained your employees can be your biggest vulnerability. According to the Ponemon Institute’s 2018 Cost of a Breach Study, human error accounts for 27% of the root causes of data breaches. Cyber security training will slash these percentage down as employees learn about correct cyber security hygiene and habits. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 4: Update Cybersecurity Defenses Cyber security firms will perform routine patch management on every device in the network. Each hardware in the network can potentially house security vulnerabilities in their operating systems. The developers of these programs routinely “patch” these security holes and IT teams download and install these patches on their network devices. Your cyber security partner will install these patches and keep them up-to-date to protect your network from malware that will exploit weaknesses. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 5: Detect and Remediate Cybersecurity Issues A cyber security provider will routinely monitor the processes within your network and keep an eye out for irregularities. They’ll also perform every method of scanning for malware and viruses within their arsenal to see if newer forms of malware have wormed their way into the infrastructure. If their detection methods find anything, they will immediately clean the malware and restore your system to its working condition. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 6: Help Your Business with Compliance As huge data breaches come into mainstream consciousness, more and more governments have started hefting the responsibility of protecting customer data onto corporations and businesses. They introduce laws to do this and fine entities which don’t comply. One chief example of this is the European Union which instituted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to prevent data breaches and fight against cybercrime by forcing companies to prepare for these potential issues. Failure to meet any of the GDPR’s statutes can mean fines for the offending company aside from damages resulting from a breach. A cyber security firm will help your company meet these regulations by keeping your network up to standard. They will also help you shape policies in your company around cybersecurity so you stay within compliance requirements. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 7: Your Crisis Response Team If and when an attack happens, your cyber security firm will know exactly what to do. For example, they’ll employ solutions like Comodo during a DDOS attack. Should your company suffer from an ongoing data breach, they’ll quickly go into action to resolve the situation as fast as possible in order to staunch the bleeding. As you can see, a cyber security provider can do a lot for your business. The true value of partnering with a cyber security company is that it will help your company grow by protecting business continuity and fostering an environment where employees can feel safe to work. A safe working environment plus keeping your reputation clean can guarantee your business’ success in the long term. Cyber security firm trust and use layered cyber security solutions like Comodo Endpoint Protection.

Data from the National Cyber Security Alliance shows that 60 percent of small and mid-sized business close after 6 months following an attack. Businesses which fall prey to hackers and cybercriminals lose their customers’ trust and their clients’ repeat business. This is why investing in the services of a firm that handles cyber security for business is a must-have investment. Let’s take a closer look at why you should partner with a cyber security provider today: Cyber Security for Business Advantage 1: Protect Your Business from Cyber Attacks A cyber security provider’s main task is to protect your business from all forms of cyber-attacks. They will deploy security solutions like Comodo Endpoint Protection system to keep malware and hackers at bay. Their services revolve around actively updating your defenses and monitoring network activity to meet that end. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 2: Identify Weaknesses in Your Network Infrastructure Your network potentially harbors security vulnerabilities which will allow attackers entry into your system. When you hire a cyber security firm, one of the first things they’ll do is to audit every nook and cranny of your network for weaknesses. They’ll then report their findings to you and develop an action plan to plug these security holes and strengthen your network. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 3: Provide Cybersecurity Training If left untrained your employees can be your biggest vulnerability. According to the Ponemon Institute’s 2018 Cost of a Breach Study, human error accounts for 27% of the root causes of data breaches. Cyber security training will slash these percentage down as employees learn about correct cyber security hygiene and habits. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 4: Update Cybersecurity Defenses Cyber security firms will perform routine patch management on every device in the network. Each hardware in the network can potentially house security vulnerabilities in their operating systems. The developers of these programs routinely “patch” these security holes and IT teams download and install these patches on their network devices. Your cyber security partner will install these patches and keep them up-to-date to protect your network from malware that will exploit weaknesses. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 5: Detect and Remediate Cybersecurity Issues A cyber security provider will routinely monitor the processes within your network and keep an eye out for irregularities. They’ll also perform every method of scanning for malware and viruses within their arsenal to see if newer forms of malware have wormed their way into the infrastructure. If their detection methods find anything, they will immediately clean the malware and restore your system to its working condition. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 6: Help Your Business with Compliance As huge data breaches come into mainstream consciousness, more and more governments have started hefting the responsibility of protecting customer data onto corporations and businesses. They introduce laws to do this and fine entities which don’t comply. One chief example of this is the European Union which instituted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to prevent data breaches and fight against cybercrime by forcing companies to prepare for these potential issues. Failure to meet any of the GDPR’s statutes can mean fines for the offending company aside from damages resulting from a breach. A cyber security firm will help your company meet these regulations by keeping your network up to standard. They will also help you shape policies in your company around cybersecurity so you stay within compliance requirements. Cyber Security for Business Advantage 7: Your Crisis Response Team If and when an attack happens, your cyber security firm will know exactly what to do. For example, they’ll employ solutions like Comodo during a DDOS attack. Should your company suffer from an ongoing data breach, they’ll quickly go into action to resolve the situation as fast as possible in order to staunch the bleeding. As you can see, a cyber security provider can do a lot for your business. The true value of partnering with a cyber security company is that it will help your company grow by protecting business continuity and fostering an environment where employees can feel safe to work. A safe working environment plus keeping your reputation clean can guarantee your business’ success in the long term. Cyber security firm trust and use layered cyber security solutions like Comodo Endpoint Protection.

"Reading Time: 5 minutes With millions of people using the Internet daily for several different activities ranging from paying bills to buying and selling, the need for a reliable Internet security measure is indeed increasing. This insists on the need for Internet security to be able to protect financial details and everything handled by an organization’s network hardware or servers. Failing to use the correct Internet security will only cause a drastic impact on any business or several other processes through which data gets transmitted all over the Internet. Using good Internet security measures will help you to: · Prevent malicious attacks execute on any network · Protect all sensitive data that is important for your business · Prevent illegal access to the network · Reject programs from specific resources capable of getting infected · Remove any malicious element present in an already existing network 10 Internet Security Tips for 2020 1. Lock up your computer Leaving your PC unattended makes room for attack and insertion of malware. To prevent this is it always recommended that you lock up PC even if you are going to be away from it for a very short time period. Locking of your PC is also essential particularly if you have any confidential data stored on an external hard drive or a flash drive. 2. Websites with HTTPS are secure URLs are not secure when they start with ‘https://’. URLs starting with ‘https://’ are considered to be safe as they use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) along with the Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. This highlights the fact that everything that happens between your browser and the web server gets encrypted, thus protecting all your Internet activities. 3. Exercise safe clicking rules If you come across a suspicious or doubtful link, never click on it immediately and instead go ahead and take another look at the URL of the website the link directs you to. Malicious actors frequently become attracted to spelling mistakes and use these as a tool to direct you to an unfriendly domain. 4. Have different passwords for all your accounts As users of the web, we access a number of websites and hence have too many accounts. Always have different passwords for every single account. Do not use the same passwords for all your accounts even if the password is very strong and difficult to crack. Following this rule will help prevent hackers and protect all your Internet-related activities. 5. Use difficult to answer security questions As internet users, we often tend to forget our passwords to certain sites and end up resetting them all over again. While doing this we come across security questions that will have to be answered. Coming up with genuine answers is a big NO as any hacker will be able to easily guess them. Instead, use vague and unrelated answers that can also have numerals. Make sure you remember these answers as you may have to use them in case you get locked. 6. Update your operating system and all software Popups appear occasionally just to remind you of a new update. These popups can become annoying and there are users who simply close them without even giving them a read. Failing to read these popup reminders will only make room for easy attacks and your PC will definitely have no protection. 7. Be careful when you browse Personal browsing activities like shopping or banking or paying bills should be performed on your own device and on a trustworthy a network as hackers are out there to instantly steal all your data and use it for illegal purposes. 8. Delete suspicious email attachments Never open any doubtful attachments or links sent by strangers. If you do receive them, instantly delete them as hackers generally send malware by hacking an email account and sending emails to all the contacts on a victim’s contact list. If you get an email from known contacts and if it looks suspicious, immediately email those individuals and let them know that they could have been hacked. These known contacts will have to change their password and activate 2-step authentication. 9. Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi Using free public Wi-Fi to access websites actually puts you at risk of allowing an individual to seize your data. This is true because it is just not possible to find out how protected any public Wi-Fi can be. However, if you are in a situation where you have to urgently use the net, then make sure to switch off file sharing on your PC prior to connecting your PC to the free Wi-Fi connection. Also, make sure that you are connected to a VPN Access and never sign into any website asking for a password. 10. Share minimal sensitive data With Facebook, Twitter and other social networks becoming greatly popular these days, individuals using them post everything happening in their lives on these networks. These individuals ignore the fact that there are criminals out there who can become their friend very easily and obtain access to almost all their personal details. Hence, we have to be cautious about what we really need to post on these social networks. As users of the internet, it is indeed our responsibility to close all vulnerable holes that allow hackers to enter your personal world. All these key Internet security tips and many more will help secure all your browsing activities and private data available online. Following the above-mentioned tips is a growing necessity as malicious people could steal your documents, personal information, and identity. Along with the growing popularity of the Internet, we find that fraudsters have simultaneously started to look for ways and means of stealing data from vulnerable online businesses and individuals. Since the Internet is extremely important in today’s world, the best thing that you can do is to protect yourself with a 24/7 protection solution like the Comodo Free Internet Security Suite. The Comodo Free Internet Security Suite prevents most of the cyber attacks and malware which can steal all your private data stored on your computer and allow hackers to get unauthorized access to your computer, personal and financial information.

"A researcher was able to crack 70 percent of the gathered hashes in an experiment in a residential neighborhood. War-driving – the process of driving around mapping residential Wi-Fi networks in hopes of finding a vulnerability to exploit – can still pay off for attackers, apparently: A CyberArk researcher recently found he could easily slice open about 70 percent of Wi-Fi network passwords in one Tel Aviv community, all at once. CyberArk’s Ido Hoorvitch ran the experiment after observing that across multiple apartment moves, his neighbors’ mobile numbers turned out to also be their Wi-Fi passwords. He knew this because he asked to piggyback on the neighbors’ Wi-Fi while waiting for cable to be installed. From there, “I hypothesized that most people living in Israel (and globally) have unsafe Wi-Fi passwords that can be easily cracked or even guessed by curious neighbors or malicious actors,” he noted in a Tuesday blog. Well, it turns out he was right. Walking, Sniffing & Cracking in Tel Aviv To carry out the experiment, Hoorvitch gathered 5,000 Wi-Fi network hashes by strolling the streets in Tel Aviv with readily available, commercial Wi-Fi sniffing equipment. His hash-sniffing rig consisted of a $50 AWUS036ACH ALFA wireless network interface card (NIC) installed in a cheap Ubuntu machine and the Hcxdumptool utility from ZerBea. Hcxdumptool, available on GitHub, is used to capture packets from WLAN devices. The NIC has monitor-mode capabilities, which allows packet capturing without having to associate with an access point, the researcher explained. After gathering what he felt was a decent sample size of 5,000 SSIDs and password hashes, it was then time to get crackin’ – literally. “Our first step in the cracking procedure is to install Hashcat, the world’s fastest and most advanced password-recovery tool,” he said, which includes several password-cracking methods like mask and dictionary attacks. After he converted the sniffing results into a hashfile format compatible with Hashcat, he ran them through a mask attack, which is a process of trying all possible combinations from a set of characters. Mask attacks are more specific than, say, brute-force attacks, because the list of characters in the set is reduced based on information an attacker knows. In this case, the Hashcat command tried all of the possible cellphone number combinations in Israel against each hash. “We chose to start with what’s called a mask attack, due to the terrible habit many people living in Israel have of using their cellphone numbers as Wi-Fi passwords,” he said, adding that this approach becomes easier because the Israeli cellphone prefix is always the same: 05. “[Numbers] are 10 digits long and it starts with 05,” Hoorvitch explained. “Therefore, we need to guess the remaining eight digits. Each digit has 10 options (0-9), hence 10**8 possible combinations.” That translates into millions of combinations, but his laptop was able to cycle through 194,000 hashes per second. Upon the first run of the mask, he was able to crack 2,200 passwords. The next step was mounting a standard dictionary attack, in which a set of common passwords is tried against a given account. “With the most common dictionary, Rockyou.txt, [we] cracked more than 900 hashes,” said Hoorvitch, bringing the total to around 3,500 cracked passwords, or 70 percent of the hashes he had gathered. Roaming Insecurity While the obvious moral of the story is that most people use dumb passwords, the other part of the narrative is the fact that Hoorvitch used a relatively new sniffing technique that only works with routers that support roaming features (which he details in his post). Roaming routers are usually deployed in city- or campus-mesh type situations where Wi-Fi is deployed as a blanket of internet access using multiple access points (APs). They use something called PMKID keys, which are unique key identifiers used to keep track of the password hash being used for the client as a person moves from router to router, to ensure continuous connectivity. Many routers have dual-purpose capabilities so that roaming options often show up in APs in residential settings even though their owners don’t need the functionality. “Not all routers support roaming features and are, therefore, not vulnerable to the PMKID attack,” Hoorvitch said. “However, our research found that routers manufactured by many of the world’s largest vendors are vulnerable.” Thus, turning off roaming (if possible) is a good mitigation to war-driving. Otherwise, previous sniffing techniques required an attacker to be able to intercept the four-way handshake that happens when someone connects an AP – which prevents any cracking at scale. “As I estimated beforehand, the process of sniffing Wi-Fis and the subsequent cracking procedures was a very accessible undertaking in terms of equipment, costs and execution,” the researcher noted. “The bottom line is that in a couple of hours and with approximately $50, your neighbor or a malicious actor can compromise your privacy and much more if you don’t have a strong password.” How to Protect Against Wi-Fi Cyberattacks Exploitation stakes can be high when it comes to routers: Hoorvitch pointed out that breaking into a residential network allows attackers to pivot to any of its connected devices to steal information or drop malware. With people working from home since the pandemic, this could also have big consequences for business data protection. “For the small business, the risk lies in an attacker infiltrating a network and then moving laterally to high-value applications or data, such as a billing system or cashier,” according to the analysis. “Concerning the enterprise, it’s possible for an attacker to gain initial access to a remote user’s Wi-Fi and then hop to the user’s computer and wait for a VPN connection or for the user to go to the office and move laterally from there.” To protect themselves, users should of course replace any default usernames and passwords, and choose complex passwords. They should also disable weak encryption protocols (such as WAP or WAP1) and disable WPS, the researcher advised.","T1003 OS Credential Dumping,T1082 System Information Discovery,T1018 Remote System Discovery","<s>[INST] A researcher was able to crack 70 percent of the gathered hashes in an experiment in a residential neighborhood.

"Attackers have long used distributed denial of service attacks to knock domain-name servers offline but over the last several months malware creators have taken to using DNS requests to tunnel stolen data. CANCUN–Attackers have long used distributed denial of service attacks to knock domain-name servers offline but over the last several months malware creators have taken to using DNS requests to tunnel stolen data. Jaime Blasco, vice president and chief scientist at AlienVault, showed a handful of real malware samples that are using this technique at the Kaspersky Lab Security Analyst Summit Tuesday. Blasco, who’s identified suspicious domains before, took the crowd through the motions by discussing some tools to use: NSTX, OzymanDNS, Iodine and perhaps the best known, DNScat. The apps allow users to upload files, run shells, and powershell scripts to download other payloads to use within attacks. For the attack, Blasco described how there has to be an upstream channel which has a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that has a minimum label length of 63 octets and a maximum domain length of 255 octets. The downstream channel can store a handful of different files in the: TXT records, CNAME records, NULL records and on occasion AAAA records. As part of an experiment Blasco and company found 50 million files that contained traffic, threw it into a parser and found that many malware samples store a URL in a TXT file and tell it which piece of spyware or malware to deploy. “There’s a bunch of software that are using DNS in a weird way,” Blasco said. One of the types of malware they found, FeederBot, was using base64 to encode and had an RC4 encrypted payload. Others used base64 and XOR. Blasco also stumbled upon FrameworkPOS, a fairly recent POS malware variant that was curiously spotted using DNS, although he believes the creators were either testing it out to allow DNS or had access to a company that used it. Morto, a worm that’s been around for a while and PlugX, a remote administration tool that’s existed in some incarnation since 2008, but has been making a return as of late, also turned up. Blasco said that since outbound DNS is usually allowed on corporate networks, many attackers have used it and avoided detection with a simple network protector like MyDLP. Anomalies in DNS traffic, like large content in TXT or NULL records, or a spike in DNS queries, or queries with long domains and subdomains are signs that something fishy might be afoot with a system’s DNS requests, he said. : Malware Security Analyst Summit Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses","<s>[INST] Attackers have long used distributed denial of service attacks to knock domain-name servers offline but over the last several months malware creators have taken to using DNS requests to tunnel stolen data.

Anomalies in DNS traffic, like large content in TXT or NULL records, or a spike in DNS queries, or queries with long domains and subdomains are signs that something fishy might be afoot with a system’s DNS requests, he said. : Malware Security Analyst Summit Vulnerabilities Web Security [/INST] T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter,T1021 Remote Services,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information,T1105 Ingress Tool Transfer,T1562 Impair Defenses </s>"
"DHS CERT published an alert prompted by a paper delivered at USENIX regarding the security of browser cookies. In case didn’t know or need a reminder, browser cookies aren’t exactly impervious to attack. The DHS-sponsored CERT at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University this week dropped an alert that warns users about the continued prevalence of a class of cookie vulnerabilities that puts users’ privacy and even financial well-being at risk. The alert was prompted by a research paper presented at last month’s USENIX Security Symposium called “Cookies Lack Integrity: Real-World Implications,” [pdf] written by Xiaofeng Zheng, Jian Jiang, Jinjin Liang, Haixin Duan, Shuo Chen, Tao Wan and Nicholas Weaver of China’s Tsinghua University, International Computer Science Institute, Microsoft, Huawei Canada, and the University of California Berkeley. The paper takes an in-depth tour of cookie-injection attacks, which can happen even over secure HTTPS connections, and describes vulnerabilities and implementation weaknesses in the RFC 6265 cookie specification that compound the issue. The attack described at USENIX involves a network-based sitting in a man-in-the-middle position who can inject cookies in an HTTP session that will also attach themselves to HTTPS connections. The researchers said the vulnerabilities are present in a number of heavily-trafficked sites—they identify Google and Bank of America by name—and added that a number of consequences could include privacy violations, account hijacking and financial loss. “You are on a network which the attacker can control (such as at Starbucks or an open WiFi). The attacker temporarily hijacks your browser to insert cookies for a targeted site,” Weaver told Threatpost. “Now, sometime later when you visit the site (on a different network, under different circumstances), your browser presents the bad cookies to the site, and the site acts on the bad cookies in a site-dependent way. EG, it could just simply track the user, or it could be a full XSS attack buried in the cookie itself.” In the paper, the researchers note that domain isolation of cookies is weak and that different but related domains can have a shared cookie scope. From the paper: “A cookie may have a “secure” flag, indicating that it should only be presented over HTTPS, ensuring confidentiality of its value against a network man-in-the-middle (MITM). However, there is no similar measure to protect its integrity from the same adversary: an HTTP response is allowed to set a secure cookie for its domain. An adversary on a related domain capable of disrupting cookie integrity by making use of shared cookie.” Not even the Same-Origin Policy, which is meant to wall content between domains, is an effective deterrent in these attacks because the network-based attacker can force the victim’s browser to visit a malicious site. “Since RFC 6265 does not specify any mechanism to provide isolation and integrity guarantees, web browser implementations do not always authenticate the domain setting a cookie,” the CERT alert said. “A malicious attacker can utilize this to set a cookie that is later used via an HTTPS connection instead of the cookie set by the actual site.” The researchers suggest a number of possible mitigations, chief among them the implementation of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and changes browser makers can address. The paper also proposes a proof-of-concept browser extension that better isolates cookies between HTTP and HTTPS domains. “HSTS prevents your browser from accepting the attacker’s cookies for all HSTS supporting sites you’ve already visited, since they come through HTTP not HTTPS,” Weaver said. “So any site which sets HSTS to its base domain and all subdomains is effectively immune. “[Browsers] need to change how cookies operate, which is always an area fraught with risk because of the possibility that a more secure cookie policy might break existing websites,” Weaver said. : Hacks Vulnerabilities Web Security","T1566 Phishing,T1027 Obfuscated Files or Information","<s>[INST] DHS CERT published an alert prompted by a paper delivered at USENIX regarding the security of browser cookies.
